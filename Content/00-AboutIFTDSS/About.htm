It is available to all interested users, regardless of agency or organizational affiliation.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is designed to address the planning needs of users with a variety of skills, backgrounds, and needs. A simple and intuitive interface provides the ability to model fire behavior across an area of interest under a variety of weather conditions and easily generate downloadable maps, graphs, and tables of model results. Additionally, the application provides a step by step process for testing a variety of fuels treatment impacts (thin, clear cut, prescribed burn) on fire behavior and comparing results to determine which modeled treatment best achieves desired results in terms of reduced fire behavior potential. It can be used at a variety of scales from local to landscape level.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> hosts a complete set of reference data available for the entire US including LANDFIRE fuels information, SILVIS Wildland Urban Interface, Agency Ownership, as well as a modern map interface allowing users to create or upload their own data.</p>
