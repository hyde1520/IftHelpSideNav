        <h1>Whats New</h1>
        <h2>Version 3.2.1 Exposure Analysis – Released March 6 2020</h2>
        <p>Version 3.2.1 includes Exposure Analysis which is used to quickly summarize Landscape Burn Probability (LBP)outputs across the extent of a Highly Valued Resources or Asset Set (HVRA Set):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
Run Exposure Analysis to summarize burn probability, conditional flame length, and integrated hazard across the extent of your Highly Valued Resources or Asset Sets (HVRA Sets).</li>
            <li>Need to re-run an LBP model on a treated landscape to compare results? Now you can select an ignition profile from a previous run to replicate the exact LBP model conditions on a treated landscape.</li>
            <li>Phased Release - Exposure Analysis is one in a series of phased releases that will facilitate Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment - Under Development</h2>
        <p>A workflow and tools to perform a Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA) from the project to the unit scale is under development in IFTDSS. The process follows the steps outlined in GTR-315, “<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr315.pdf" target="_blank">A wildfire risk assessment framework for land and resource management</a>.” IFTDSS is unique in that it will contain a comparison functionality allowing users to complete a QWRA and then compare treatment alternatives to understand the potential impacts on risk.</p>
