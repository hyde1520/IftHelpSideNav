                <p>In the Develop Treatment Alternative task, on the "compare" step, horizontal "streaking" sometimes appears in the Landscape Change layer for large landscapes. These streaks do not reflect raster changes, they are introduced due to a re-sampling issue on the ArcGIS server.</p>

                <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">This text may be used if IFT-2555 gets implemented. For landscapes created prior to July 2018, you may notice the blue boundary around the landscape does not perfectly match the edge of the landscape. This does not affect your data or use of the landscape in analyses. The issue occurs because the landscape data is generated using a custom Albers projection that is unique to each one, while Map Studio uses a universal projection. As a result, the upper left and lower right corners of the boundary match those of the landscape, but the sides are not an exact match. </p>

                <p>Multipart shapes that lie in close proximity to a landscape may appear in drop-down menus for landscape tasks such as summarizing or modeling. While <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically filters these drop-down menus to show only shapes that intersect the landscape in question, these multipart shapes may be included if their extent intersects the landscape, regardless of whether the individual polygons that make up the shape do. In the example below, the multipart shape would appear in the drop-down because its extent, roughly indicated with a dotted line, intersects the landscape, even though neither polygon does. If a report were generated for the landscape using that multipart shape area of interest, the landscape features and/or model outputs would all be 0.</p>
