            <p>Spotting Probability is treated differently by IFTDSS than in WFDSS NTFB / FARSITE.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Spotting Probability input (0-100%) controls how many of the pixels, where crown fire is initiated, actually launch embers which can “spot” to start new fires. Entering 100% means that all points on the landscape where crown fire is initiated will launch embers. A value of 0% in essence turns off spotting. Spotting Probability of 20% is the recommended input and the default in IFTDSS. For details about how far embers go and how many result in spot fires, see the Spotting Technical Detail section below.</p>
