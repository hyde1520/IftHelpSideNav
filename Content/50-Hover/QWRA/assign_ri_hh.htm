        <p>Relative importance weights are used to emphasize the effects to HVRAs that have reason to be prioritized over others. Without articulating relative importance, all HVRAs would be weighted equally and characterization of risk in areas of overlapping HVRAs may not appropriately reflect management objectives or the tradeoffs associated with competing or conflicting objectives.</p>
