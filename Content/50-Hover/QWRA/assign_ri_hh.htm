        <p>Relative Importance is a weighted summation of risk across HVRAs to address that fact that, often times, several HVRAs overlap the same geographic location. Relative importance should reflect fire management objectives and priorities, or the tradeoffs associated with competing or conflicting objectives.</p>
        <p>The most important Primary HVRA and sub-HVRA are assigned a RI of 100, and the others are assigned a value ranging from 1-100.</p>
