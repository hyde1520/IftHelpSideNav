        <p>Relative Importance (RI) is used to account for the fact that some HVRAs have reason to be prioritized over others due to policy, land management objectives, or other factors. RI&#160;ranges in value from 1 (less important) to 100 (most important). When assigning RI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For Primary HVRAs, assign a value of 100 to the highest priority resource. Others may be assigned value between 1-100. You may have more than one Primary HVRA with a value of 100.</li>
            <li>For Sub-HVRAs, assign a value of 100 to the highest priority in each Primary HVRA Category. Other Sub-HVRAs may be assigned value between 1-100 within that category as well. Multiple Sub-HVRAs may be assigned a value of 100.</li>
            <li>Once populated you may review your selections using the dynamic pie chart which calculates over-all importance percentages for both Primary HVRAs (inner circle) and associated Sub-HVRAs (outer circle).  Hovering over a portion of the circle will pop up with an overall importance value which takes into account the RF, RI, and Relative extent (acreage) of Sub-HVRA.</li>
        </ul>
