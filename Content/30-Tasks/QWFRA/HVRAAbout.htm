        <h1>Highly Valued Resources or Assets</h1>
        <p>A Highly Valued Resource or Asset (HVRA) is a feature on the landscape that is influenced positively and/or negatively by fire. Some resources have only modest value and may not be analyzed in an assessment of risk to HVRAs. Likewise, low-value assets like outbuildings are often left un-analyzed so that efforts can be focused on the more highly valued resources and assets (HVRAs). HVRAs are sorted as primary and sub-HVRAs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Primary HVRAs</b> are the overall categories into which the sub-HVRAs are sorted. For example, habitat can be the primary HVRA, with sub-HVRAs defined as the habitat for  individual species. When calculating risk, all calculations are done at the sub-HVRA level.</li>
            <li><b>Sub-HVRAs</b>  fit within primary HVRAs. For example, powerlines can be considered a sub-HVRA, and Infrastructure would be the primary HVRA.  Quantitatively, all calculations are done at the sub-HVRA level. The hierarchical structure is simply a convenient way to organize and summarize a long list of HVRAs.</li>
        </ul>
