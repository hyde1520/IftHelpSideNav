        <h1>Using a CSV to Import Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA) Inputs</h1>
        <p>When conducting a Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA), you may download a spreadsheet (.csv file) form <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, fill it out, and upload it to populate the Response Function (RF) and Relative Importance (RI) input values. This can be useful when you have several Primary HVRA and sub-HVRAs to populate or want to copy/paste values.  Instructions for this are outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Download and Populate the Spreadsheet</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>When on the QWRA model input page, select your Exposure Analysis (EA) output from the drop-down menu.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <span class="UIcomponent">Download/Upload RI/RF Spreadsheet</span>, located in the bottom of the <span class="UIcomponent">Select an Exposure Analysis</span> panel.</p>

            <li>
                <p>The spreadhseet name is pre-populated with that of your EA, but you may rename it if needed. Click <span class="UIcomponent">Download RF/RI Template</span> to download a template to your local computer. This template comes pre-populated with the Primary HVRA and sub-HVRA names used in your EA.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open the spreadsheet on your local computer and populate the RF and RI values for each row.</p>
                <div class="notificationTip">
                    <p>If you used HVRA National data in your EA, the RFs for those are also pre-populated in the spreadsheet. You may edit any of these values.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="notificationImportant">
                    <p>Columns D and G-M need to be populated.</p>
                    <p><span class="Emphasis">Do Not </span>edit or delete other columns, this will cause the upload back to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to fail.</p>
                </div>
                <p>As you fill in the spreadsheet, note that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may find it helpful to expand the columns to view the full header titles (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/adjust-the-column-size-to-see-everything-4b72b631-ee0a-4539-b1be-499fedc14fe2" target="_blank">Excel instructions are linked here <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>).</li>
                    <li>The most important Primary HVRA should be assigned an RI of 100, the rest assigned a value between 1-100. At least one primary needs to be assigned 100</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The “Primary RI” column only requires the first row of each Sub-HVRA to be populated. For example in the image below, the Primary RI of “10” entered in the first row for the Air Quality Sub-HVRA applies to all the Air Quality Sub-HVRAs.</p>

                        <p>Response functions must be a value ranging from –100 (strong loss) to 100 (strong benefit).</p>

        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>When saving, leave the spreadsheet in .csv format. Do not save as .xls or .xlsx as these will not upload to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></p>

                <p>Your RI/RF values are now populated in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. You may still adjust these values in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> interface if needed, but those changes<span class="Emphasis"> are not saved</span> to your .csv. You may now finish the QWRA run as you would normally, giving the run a name and either selecting <span class="UIcomponent">Run</span>, or <span class="UIcomponent">Save</span> to return and run later.</p>
