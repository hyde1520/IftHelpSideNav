        <h2>Calculating <MadCap:keyword term="Relative Importance Per Pixel" />Relative Importance Per Pixel <MadCap:keyword term="RIPP" />(RIPP)</h2>
        <p>In order to calculate Conditional Weighted NVC, first the Relative Importance Per Pixel (RIPP) needs to be calculated.  RIPP takes into account the Relative Importance (RI) values for both Primary HVRA Categories and the Sub-HVRAs entered in the application, as well as the Relative Extent (RE) which is the number of burnable pixels in each Sub-HVRA footprint.  We include the calculated RIPP values within the download package.</p>
        <p>There are a three steps involved in calculating RIPP:</p>
        <h3>RIPP&#160;Calculation Step 1</h3>
        <p>The first relies on the Primary HVRA Category RI values to calculate ‘Of1M.’ In the example spreadsheet, the ‘Primary HVRA RI’ is what was entered into the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> interface. The ‘Percent of total Primary RI’ is the percentage of the given Primary HVRA RI relative to the sum of all the Primary HVRA RI values.  And ‘Of1M’ is the ‘Percent of total Primary RI’ multiplied by 1,000,000.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/External/Xlsx_QWRA_Ripp1.png" alt="Primary HVRA &quot;Communities&quot; row outlined in Red, the Of1M value for that row is 281,690." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>For example, we will illustrate the calculations for Communities:</p>
        <p>‘Of1M<sub>Communities</sub>’ = (Primary HVRA RI<sub>Communities</sub> / (Primary HVRA RI<sub>Wilderness</sub> + Primary HVRA RI<sub>Air Quality</sub> + Primary HVRA RI <sub>Infrastructure</sub>  + Primary HVRA RI <sub>Recreation</sub> + Primary HVRA RI <sub>Communities</sub> + Primary HVRA RI <sub>Ecosystem Function</sub>  + Primary HVRA RI <sub>RCW</sub> + Primary HVRA RI <sub>Salamanders</sub>)) * 1,000,000</p>
        <p>= (100 / (20 + 20 + 100  +15 + 100 + 40  +40 + 20)) * 1,000,000</p>
        <p>= 0.281690 * 1,000,000</p>
        <p>= 281,690</p>
        <h3>RIPP&#160;Calculation Step 2</h3>
        <p>Second, the sum product of the Sub-HVRA RE and RI are calculated for each Primary HVRA Category independently. For this calculation, the ‘Sub-HVRA RI’ is  what was entered into the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> interface. This value is divided by 100, ‘Sub-HVRA RI / 100’.  Then that is multiplied by the ‘Relative Extent (pixels)’ to get the ‘Sum’.  Finally the ‘Sum Product” is calculated, which is the product of the summed values within a given Primary HVRA Category.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/External/Xlsx_QWRA_Ripp2.png" alt="the three &quot;Communities&quot; Sub-HVRA rows are outlined in red, their Sum Product is 44,093." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>We will continue with the Communities example:</p>
        <p>‘Sum Product <sub>Communities</sub>’ = ((Sub HVRA RI <sub>Low</sub> /100) * RE <sub>Low</sub>) + (Sub HVRA RI <sub>Moderate</sub> /100) * RE <sub>Moderate</sub>) + (Sub HVRA RI <sub>High</sub> /100) * RE <sub>High</sub>)</p>
        <p>= ((0.2 * 135,842) + (0.5 * 25,039) + (1 * 4,405))</p>
        <p>= 27,168 + 12,520 + 4,405</p>
        <p>= 44,093</p>
        <h3>RIPP&#160;Calculation Step 3</h3>
        <p>Third, to calculate the RIPP for a given Sub-HVRA, the ‘Of1M’, ‘Sum Product’ and ‘Sub-HVRA RI / 100’ are used.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/External/Xlsx_QWRA_ripp3.png" alt="The &quot;Communities&quot; row is outlined in red, its RIPP value is 1.2777." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>We will continue with the Communities example calculating RIPP for the Low Sub-HVRA.</p>
        <p>RIPP <sub>Low</sub> = (‘Of1M <sub>Communities</sub>’ / ‘Sum Product <sub>Communities</sub>’) * (Sub HVRA RI <sub>Low</sub> /100))</p>
        <p>= (281,690 / 44,093) * 0.2</p>
        <p>=1.2777</p>

        <p>Conditional Weighted NVC (C(wNVC)) is conditional on a fire occurring, therefore it does not include Burn Probability in the calculation. C(wNVC) is calculated for each pixel using the  Proportion of Flame Length outputs from Landscape Burn Probability model outputs, Response Functions (RF) and Relative Importance Per Pixel (RIPP) for all Sub-HVRAs present.</p>

        <p>Conditional Weighted NVC is the sum of the product of RIPP, Response Functions and Proportion of Flame Lengths (by class) for all Sub-HVRAs present.</p>
