        <h1>Downloading Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA) Outputs</h1>
        <p>You can download your Risk Assessment (Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment, QWRA) outputs for use outside of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This can be done from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> by clicking on the Risk Assessment file to show the file options, then clicking <span class="UIcomponent">Download</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Downloading</h2>
        <p>When the File Download window opens, by default the folder has the same Risk Assessment name you selected when running a QWRA. If you prefer to change the name for use on your computer you can click on the name field and type a different name, this does not change the name in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
