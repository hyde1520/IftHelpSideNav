        <h1>About Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment (QWFRA) [<b style="color: #ff0000;">UNDER DEVELOPMENT</b>]</h1>

        <p>Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment (QWFRA) describes the process of modeling fire behavior, defining highly valued resources and assets (HVRAs) and their response to fire on your landscape, and assessing benefits and threats to these resources. This process of identifying HVRAs and characterizing threats and benefits from fire can be helpful to land and fire managers as they locate and plan fuel treatments, monitoring programs, and other activities on the landscape.</p>

            <p><b>Terms to Know:</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Risk:</b> The "Risk" assessment encompasses both threats and benefits from fire. Some resources may benefit from fire occurrence (i.e. fire dependent plant species) while others may experience loss (i.e. infrastructure).</p>
            <p><b>HVRAs</b>: Highly Valued Resources and Assets. Features on the landscape that are influenced positively and/or negatively by fire.</p>
        </div>
        <p>QWFRA accounts for both losses and benefits resulting from fire and takes into account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How often fire occurs (Likelihood)</li>
            <li>The intensity when a fire occurs (intensity)</li>
            <li>The effects of fire on HVRAs (susceptibility)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment in IFTDSS</h2>
        <div class="notificationComingSoon">
            <p>This section will be continually updated as the Development Team releases QWFRA functional</p>
        </div>
        <p>QWFRA is a collection of several actions; fire modeling, mapping and characterizing values, comparisons, etc. Because each of these can be useful on its own, as well as part of a larger assess, the Development Team has chosen to phase QWFRA into IFTDSS throughout 2019 rather than waiting longer and releasing everything at once. Below is short list of current and upcoming IFTDSS versions and the capabilities that will be released with them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Version 3.2.0</b>: <a href="../../20-Models/LBP/About.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Burn Probability Model</a> added to Modeling Playground. Model landscape burn probability, conditional flame lengths, and integrated hazard. View the results in Map Studio, as a summary report, or download them to your local computer for use in other applications.</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.1</b> <u>Map Values</u>: <u>Complete and Exposure Analysis (“Exposure”)</u>: Map Highly Valued Resources and Assets (HVRAs) and analyze their exposure (likelihood and intensity) to modeled wildfire. View the results in Map Studio, as a summary report, or download them to your local computer for use in other applications or further analysis</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.2</b> <u>Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment</u>: Assign response functions (susceptibility) and relative importance to mapped HVRAs. Calculate Net Value Change (threats and benefits of fire) using modeled fire behavior (likelihood and intensity) and response functions (susceptibility) and relative importance (prioritization). View the results in Map Studio, as a summary report, or download them to your local computer for use in other applications or further analysis</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.3</b> <u>Compare Exposure or Risk</u>: Complete exposure analysis’ or risk assessments for related landscapes, generate comparison grids and comparison reports.</li>
        </ul>
