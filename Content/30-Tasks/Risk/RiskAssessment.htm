        <h1>About Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment (QWFRA) [<b style="color: #ff0000;">UNDER DEVELOPMENT</b>]</h1>
        <p>Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment (QWFRA) describes the process of modeling fire behavior, defining valued resources and their response to fire on your landscape, and assessing the risks to these resources. This process of identifying resources and characterizing risks from fire can be helpful to land and fire managers as they locate and plan fuel treatments, monitoring programs, and other activities on the landscape.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>The "Risk" assessment encompasses both negative and positive effects of fire. Some resources may benefit from fire occurrence (i.e. fire dependent plant species) while others may experience loss (i.e. infrastructure).</p>
        </div>
        <p>QWFRA accounts for both losses and benefits resulting from fire and takes into account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How often fire occurs (Likelihood)</li>
            <li>The intensity when a fire occurs (intensity)</li>
            <li>The effects of fire on resources (susceptibility)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h2>Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment in IFTDSS</h2>
        <div class="notificationComingSoon">
            <p>This section will be continually updated as the Development Team releases QWFRA functional</p>
        </div>
        <p>QWFRA is a collection of several actions; fire modeling, resource assessment, comparisons, etc. Because each of these can be useful on its own, as well as part of a larger assess, the Development Team has chosen to phase QWFRA into IFTDSS throughout 2019 rather than waiting longer and releasing everything at once. Below is short list of current and upcoming IFTDSS versions and the capabilities that will be released with them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Version 3.2.0</b>: <a href="../../20-Models/LBP/About.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Burn Probability Model</a> added to Modeling Playground. Model landscape burn probability, conditional flame lengths, and integrated hazard. View the results in Map Studio, as a summary report, or download them to your local computer for use in other applications.</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.1</b> <u>Map Values</u>: Select or create Highly Valued Resource Areas (HVRAs) geospatially and define their susceptibility to fire by assigning response functions and relative importance.</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.2</b> <u>Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment</u>: Define response functions and relative importance for HVRAs. View the results in Map Studio, generate a risk summary report, and download risk outputs to your local computer.</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.3</b> <u>Compare Integrated Hazard or Risk</u>: Complete an integrated hazard or risk assessment for related landscapes, generate comparison grids and comparison reports</li>
        </ul>
