        <h1>About Quantitative Risk Assessment</h1>
        <p>Quantitative Risk Assessment describes the process of analyzing the risks posed by wildfire to highly valued resource areas.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Throughout 2019 Quantitative Risk Assessment will be added to upcoming IFTDSS versions:<img src="../../Resources/Images/Models/Flammap/Risk/risk_triangle.png" alt="triangle with 'wildfire risk' written in its center, and the words 'likelihood', 'intenisty', and 'susceptibility' bordering each side" class="border" style="float: right;" /></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Version 3.2.0</b>: <a href="../../20-Models/LBP/About.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Burn Probability Model</a> added to Modeling Playground. Model landscape burn probability, conditional flame lengths, and integrated hazard, view the results in Map Studio, as a summary report, or download them to your local computer for use in other applications.</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.1</b> Single Landscape Integrated Hazard Assessment: Map Highly Valued Resource Areas (HVRAs) and generate an integrated hazard report.</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.2</b> Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment: Define response functions and relative importance for HVRAs, map risk outputs, generate a risk summary report, and download risk outputs</li>
            <li class="comingsoon"><b>Version 3.2.3</b> Compare Integrated Hazard or Risk: Complete an integrated hazard or risk assessment for related landscapes, generate comparison grids and comparison reports</li>
