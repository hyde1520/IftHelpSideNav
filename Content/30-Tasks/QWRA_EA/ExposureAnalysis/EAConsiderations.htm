        <h2>HVRA Sets for  Exposure Analysis or Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>Deciding what to include in your HVRA set should be based on how you intend to use that set. For HVRA sets intended for Exposure Analyses or Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessments (QWRAs), the geographic extent HVRAs selected should reflect the desired extent and components to be quantitatively evaluated and compared. (See the <a href="../MapValues/HVRACreate.htm" target="_blank">Map values topic</a> for details on how to create an HVRA set).</p>

        <p>Below we outline some general guidelines for assigning HVRAs for a Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment  from Scott and others (2013).  However,  every project is different and there is no one-size-fits-all criteria.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Keep the scope limited</b>: When identifying which HVRAs to include in your analysis, it is important to limit the list of HVRAs to those of high value. Keeping the scope limited ensures that the interpretation of the results from your analysis remains manageable. Additionally, the fewer HVRAs that are included in the assessment, the higher their overall contribution to the weighted risk score.</li>
            <li><b>Be deliberate in how you organize Sub-HVRAs</b>: The decision regarding how to categorize and organize your HVRAs should be driven by how you want to compare these values. Exposure Analysis reports provide results at both the Primary and Sub-HVRA level. The Primary HVRA should generally represent a category containing multiple Sub-HVRAs that will be looked at together in a management context for decisions. Primary HVRAs will often include wildland urban interface (WUI), structures, and watersheds, they may also include more ecologically significant values such as vegetation structure or type. For instance, Wildlife Habitat can be the Primary HVRA, with Sub-HVRAs identified as individual species or species groups.</li>
            <li><b>Needs vary and there are guidance documents available</b>: There are several guiding documents to assist in the assignment of HVRAs, some of these include:<ul><li>Land and Resource Management Plan or Forest Plan</li><li>Fire Management Plan</li><li>Wildland Fire Response Guidebook or Forest Response Guidebook</li></ul></li>
            <li>Involve Specialists and Analysts: It is critical to involve resource specialists and geospatial analysts in the process of assigning HVRAs. For a detailed 8 step-process on assigning HVRAs, see page 32 of <a href="../../../41-References/Citations.htm#Scott_etal_2013" target="_blank">Scott and Others 2013</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Example: Superior National Forest</h2>
        <p>The Superior National Forest conducted a QWRA as part of their process to develop a Forest-wide fuels treatment strategy. When they assigned HVRAs, the resource or asset’s role or usefulness in driving fire management decision making was the primary criteria:</p>
        <p>“<i>For example, human habitation was chosen as an HVRA because the Forest prioritizes fuel reduction treatments adjacent to areas of human habitation to mitigate the potential threat of wildfire moving to or from privately owned lands. Ecological integrity was identified as an HVRA because depicting the potential for wildfire to restore or maintain ecological integrity may help identify prescribed or managed wildfire opportunities”</i> - Don Helmbrecht 2019</p>
