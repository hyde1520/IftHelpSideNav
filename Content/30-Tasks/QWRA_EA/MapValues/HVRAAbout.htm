        <h1>About Map Values - Highly Valued Resources or Assets (HVRAs)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Map Values allows you to create a consolidated spatial layer that contains Highly Valued Resources or Assets (HVRAs) for your area. This spatial layer is known as an HVRA Set. This HVRA Set is then saved in your Workspace for easy retrieval and display in Map Studio.  Overlaying HVRA Sets with model outputs in Map Studio enables quick qualitative assessment of modeled fire behavior in relation to your mapped values.</p>
        <div class="notificationComingSoon">
            <p>Creating an HVRA Set is a prerequisite to completing an Exposure Analysis or Risk Assessment, two features that will soon be phased into IFTDSS.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Defining Map Values and HVRA Sets</h2>
        <p>Values on the landscape are things that we care about, natural resources or human-made assets for example.  In IFTDSS, the term “value” refers specifically to Highly Valued Resources or Assets (HVRAs).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Highly Valued Resources or Assets (HVRAs)</b> are landscape features that are influenced positively and/or negatively by fire. <span class="Emphasis">Resources are naturally occurring, while Assets are human-made</span>. </p>
                <p>HVRAs are categorized by Primary and Sub-HVRAs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Primary HVRAs</b> are the overall categories into which the Sub-HVRAs are sorted. For example, “habitat” can be the Primary HVRA, with Sub-HVRAs defined as the habitat for individual species.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Sub-HVRAs</b> are the geospatial component of Primary HVRA category. For example, “powerlines” can be considered a Sub-HVRA, and “infrastructure” would be the Primary HVRA. The hierarchical structure is simply a convenient way to organize and summarize a long list of HVRAs.</p>

        <h2>Why Create an HVRA Set?</h2>
        <p>Map Values allows you to create a consolidated spatial layer of HVRAs (HVRA Set) consisting of the values you select. Once you build an HVRA Set in IFTDSS it is saved in your Workspace and is available throughout IFTDSS. You can quickly view HVRA Sets in Map Studio, overlaying them with different model outputs and landscapes to evaluate values against fire behavior outputs, fuels models, proposed fuel treatments, fire history, and so forth.</p>
        <p>Future versions of IFTDSS will offer Exposure Analysis and Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment capability. HVRA Sets will be a required input in these processes. Users will calculate risk (an estimate of the benefits or losses) based on Landscape Burn Probability model outputs.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Using HVRA Sets in IFTDSS</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.QA ONLY">Deciding what to include in your HVRA set should be based on how you intend to use that set. For HVRA sets intended for Exposure Analyses or Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessments (QWRAs), the geographic extent HVRAs selected should reflect the desired extent and components to be quantitatively evaluated and compared. For HVRA sets intended to be used primarily for visual assessment and overlaying with model outputs, the HVRAs selected can be more dynamic and exploratory.</p>

        <div class="notificationTip" MadCap:conditions="General.QA ONLY">
            <p><b>For Exposure Analysis and Risk</b>:Use an LBP Model Output to set the geographic extent of your mapped values if you intend to use the resulting HVRA Set later for an Exposure Analysis or Risk Assessment. See the <a href="HVRAConsiderations.htm" target="_blank">Geographic Extent section</a> for more detail.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Follow the steps in the <a href="HVRACreate.htm" target="_blank">Map Values tutorial</a> to create and view HVRA Sets in IFTDSS. When creating sets you can specify the geographic extent from a variety sources (outlined in the section below). When selecting HVRAs, you may choose to use <a href="HVRANational.htm" target="_blank">selected IFTDSS Reference Layers, HVRA National Layers</a>, or your own shape or shapefile.</p>
        <p>See the <a href="HVRAConsiderations.htm" target="_blank">HVRA Considerations</a> topic for further information on selecting a geographic extent.</p>
