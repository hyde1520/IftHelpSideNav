        <p>Currently <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> includes LANDFIRE 2016 remapped data for the Northwest, Southwest, South Central &amp; North Central LANDFIRE GeoAreas, represented by the purple boundary in the map below. As more LANDFIRE GeoAreas are completed, they will be incorporated into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. More information about the LANDFIRE 2016 (a.k.a Remap) schedule is available at <a href="https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php" target="_blank">https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

        <p>Landscape creation will be limited to areas where LANDFIRE 2016 data fully covers the geographic extent and 4980 meter buffer surrounding it. If the area is only partially within the LANDFIRE 2016 extent, a warning message will be seen and the Create button will be disabled.  At this time either choose a new extent to create the landscape or choose from the other available LANDFIRE data versions, LANDFIRE 2012 and LANDFIRE 2014.</p>
