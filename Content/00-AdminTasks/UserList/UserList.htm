        <h1>User List</h1>
        <p>User List is where all user administration occurs in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> with the exception of FTEM&#160;users (See the <a href="../../10-FTEM/Admin/Administrators.htm" target="_blank">FTEM Administration topic</a> for those details).</p>
        <p>The left panel of User List contains filters to help you narrow the list of users based on user attributes (active vs disabled, government or non-goverment etc.). There is also a field in the top of the left panel that allows you to search for a specific user name or email.</p>
        <p>The center of the User List contains the list of users. Clicking on a user will display a list of administration options for that user's account.</p>
        <p>The right panel of User List contains User metadata.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>The right panel will remain open as long as a user is selected and user options are displayed. This allows admins to mouse over and copy any attribute from the metadata field for bug reporting, or do assist users (for example, providing a copy of the users temporary password). </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Filtering and User Definitions</h2>
