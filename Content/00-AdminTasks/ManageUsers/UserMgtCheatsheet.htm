        <h1>User Management Cheat sheet</h1>
        <p>Depending on the user's situation, the administrator may need to choose one button over another to get the user back into their account most quickly. The main buttons, their purpose, and what they do, are explained below:</p>
        <h2>Grant User Privileges </h2>
        <p>For users who need access because their account has lapsed after 90 days of inactivity or who are requesting an <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> account for the first time.</p>
        <p>Grant&#160;User Privileges makes the account active, and automatically sends the user a temporary password they may use to gain access to their <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> account.</p>
        <h2>Reset Password</h2>
        <p>For users with an active account and simply need to reset their password to something else.</p>
        <p>Reset Password automatically sends the user a temporary password they may use to gain access to their <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> account. </p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Reset password will even send temporary passwords to users with locked accounts, even though those users will not be able to successfully access their account. Locked accounts must be opened using the Unlock button, described in the next sections. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Users can accomplish the same task as the administrator by following the "Forgot Password" prompt in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> log in screen. Though they may be contacting an administrator to reset their password if they've forgotten their security question and cannot complete the "Forgot Password" process.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Unlock</h2>
        <p>For users who have locked their account by entering the incorrect password too many times. Accounts are locked after too many unsuccessful login attempts within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>User Accounts lock after the fourth unsuccessful login attempt in 24 hours. The user interface makes reference to "three"&#160;attempts, so some users may contact an administrator saying their account is locked, even though the administrator can see in the User List that the account is not yet locked.</p>
        <p>Unlock will unlock the account and automatically send the user an email containing a new temporary password they can use to regain access to their account.</p>
        <p>Allow Password Change</p>
        <p>For users who have changed their password more than once in a 24 hour period, this button may need to be used...</p>
