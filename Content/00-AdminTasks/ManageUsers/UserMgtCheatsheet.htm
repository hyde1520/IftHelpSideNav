        <h1>User Management Cheat sheet</h1>
        <h2>Granting or Restoring Access</h2>
        <p>Depending on the user's situation, there are different buttons that are visible to administrators who need to assist a user in regaining access to their account. Each is summarized below and includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Grant User Privileges</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reset Password</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Unlock</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grant User Privileges </h3>
        <p><span class="UIcomponent">Grant User Privileges</span>&#160;appears on accounts for users who either need first-time access to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> or who need to regain access because their account has lapsed after 90 days of inactivity.</p>
        <p>Grant&#160;User Privileges makes the account active, and automatically sends the user a temporary password they may use to gain access to their <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> account.</p>
        <h3>Reset Password</h3>
        <p><span class="UIcomponent">Rest Password</span> is always visible. It allows and administrator to reset a users password.</p>
        <p>Reset Password automatically sends the user a temporary password they may use to gain access to their <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> account. </p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Reset Password will not unlock a locked account. Locked accounts must be unlocked using the Unlock button, described in the next section. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Users can accomplish the same task as and administrator using "Reset Password" if they follow the "Forgot Password" prompt in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> log in screen. Though they may be contacting an administrator to reset their password if they've forgotten their security question and cannot complete the "Forgot Password" process.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Unlock</h3>
        <p><span class="UIcomponent">Unlock&#160;</span>appears on accounts for users who have locked their account by entering the incorrect password too many times. Accounts are locked if there are too many unsuccessful login attempts within a 24-hour period.</p>
        <p>Unlock will unlock the account and automatically send the user an email containing a new temporary password they can use to regain access to their account.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>User Accounts lock after the fourth unsuccessful login attempt in 24 hours. The user interface makes reference to "three"&#160;attempts, so some users may contact an administrator saying their account is locked, even though the administrator can see in the User List that the account is not yet locked.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If a user requests an unlock or password reset more than once in a 24-period period, they may be prevented from completing the process, and will see a messaging on the password reset page that informs them "Exception: Your password was updated recently and cannot be modified until 24 hours since your previous change." </p>
        <h3>Allow Password Change</h3>
        <p>For users who have changed their password more than once in a 24 hour period, this button may need to be used. This button only appears as an option on accounts that have had the password updated within 24 hours. </p>
        <p>This button "resets the clock"&#160;on a user account, allowing a user to update their password one additional time if needed within a 24-hour period.</p>
        <p>After using Allow Password Change, the admin will have to instruct the user to create a new password using the "forgot password" prompt that is visible in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> login, or the administrator may use the <span class="UIcomponent">Reset Password</span> button.</p>
        <h2>Removing Access and Archiving</h2>
        <p>Both of the below options are always available:</p>
        <h3>Disable Privileges</h3>
        <p>"Disable Privileges" disables an account and sends the user an email notification that their account has been disabled.</p>
        <p>To re-enable an account which has been disabled, use the "Grant User Privileges" button. </p>
        <h3>Archive</h3>
        <p>"Archive"&#160;disables an account and <span class="Emphasis">does not</span> send the user an email notification. This option is intended to remove dis-used accounts. For example, a user may create a second account and no longer need their old account, in which case an admin can archive the older account.</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Archived account can not be re-enabled by an administrator. </p>
        </div>
