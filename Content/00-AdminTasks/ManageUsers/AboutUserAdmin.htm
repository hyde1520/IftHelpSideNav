        <h3>Allow Password Change</h3>
        <p>The "Allow Password Change"&#160;button allows a user to change their password an additional time within a 24-hour period. By default, users may only change their password once in a 24-period. This security feature helps prevent unauthorized account access; However, there are instances where a user must change their password more than once in a 24-hour period. A user that resets their password but forgets or mid-types the new password is one such case.</p>
        <p>This button "resets the clock"&#160;on a user account, allowing a user to update their password one additional time if needed</p>
        <p>This button only appears as an option on accounts that have had the password updated within 24 hours. </p>
