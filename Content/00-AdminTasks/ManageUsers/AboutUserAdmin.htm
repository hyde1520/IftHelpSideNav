        <h1>About User Administration</h1>
        <p>There are two roles in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Users: Those with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> accounts who can access the system, generate landscapes, run models, and perform other tasks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Administrators. Administrators can assist users in creating and maintaining their accounts. This section addresses the key steps in managing <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user accounts. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All user management activities for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> are conducted from the <a href="../UserList/UserList.htm" target="_blank">User List</a>, visible under user options only for administrators.</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Fuels Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring (FTEM) users have a separate set of permissions just for FTEM.

        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Throughout this topic you'll see references to scenarios in which users contact administrators for support. That contact is carried out through the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Team's Freshdesk support ticket system. New administrators should contact a member of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Development Team if details about Freshdesk are required.</p>

        <h2>User Access and Passwords</h2>
        <p>There are three variations of approving user access or assisting users in gaining access to their accounts. Each of these are described in further depth below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="#Grant">Grant User Privileges</a>
                </p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Grant"></a>Grant User Privileges </h3>
        <p>The <span class="UIcomponent">Grant User Privileges</span> button appears on accounts for users who need either need first-time access to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, or existing users who have had their accounts disabled due to inactivity.</p>

        <p>The <span class="UIcomponent">Allow Password Change</span>&#160;button allows a user to change their password an additional time within a 24-hour period. By default, users may only change their password once in a 24-period. This security feature helps prevent unauthorized account access.

        <p>This button "resets the clock"&#160;on a user account, allowing a user to update their password one additional time if needed</p>
        <p>This button only appears as an option on accounts that have had the password updated within 24 hours. </p>
