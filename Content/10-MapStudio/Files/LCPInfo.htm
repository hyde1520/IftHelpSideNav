        <p>A <a href="LCPInfo.htm" target="_blank">Landscape file (.LCP)</a> is a multi-band raster format commonly used by wildland fire behavior and fire effects models such as FARSITE and FlamMap. The bands of an .LCP file store data describing terrain, tree canopy, and fuel model (outlined in the table below). The .LCP file defines your project area and is the first input needed to run most models in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. LCP's generated in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> are derived from  <a href="../../00-Concepts/LANDFIRE.htm" target="_blank">LANDFIRE</a>.</p>

        <h2><a name="Buffering"></a>Buffering</h2>
        <p>Landscapes created in IFTDSS are automatically given a 4980 meter buffer, as seen below outside of the blue boundary. This buffer is useful for modeling capabilities such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modeling Landscape Burn Probability  requiring ignitions placed outside of a landscape so that fires can burn onto the landscape. Additionally, fires that start within the landscape must be able to burn into the buffer to avoid erroneous edge effects.</li>
            <li>Minimum Travel Time Fire Spread (to be released in a future version) modeling where you may want to simulate an ignition that occurs outside your landscape and burns into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/layer_list/BufferedLandscape.png" alt="landscape with a buffer visibile in all directions beyond the blue landscape boundary line" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.QA ONLY">The buffer is added to allow fires to freely burn into and out of the landscape extent (non-buffered), eliminating potential edge effects where fires do not spread to their full potential, biasing the fire-size distribution and therefore burn probability.   The buffer distance was chosen because Landscape Burn Probability models single burn periods, and under most fuel and weather conditions the longest axis of a fire does not exceed this distance,  meaning edge effects will not impact the model outputs used in reports and subsequent analyses.</p>
        <p>Pictured below is a ample of simulated wildfire perimeters from Landscape Burn Probability model showing the need for a buffer to allow these fires to freely burn into and out of the Landscape Extent (non-buffered) portion of a Landscape.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.QA ONLY">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/GetStarted/buffer_for_fire_modeling_burn_perimeters_700px.jpg" alt="A solid box can be seen. The landscape extent is inside the box the buffer is outside the box and fire perimeters are allowed to start outside the box and burn into it." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>The Landscape Extent, beyond which the boundary extends, is delineated by the blue line when viewing it in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. This line may be hidden by unselecting it in the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>.</p>
        <p>Landscapes created in earlier versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (prior to the Version 3.1.1, 25 October 2018) were not assigned a buffer because that feature did not exist yet. These early landscapes also have blue boundary, but lack the surrounding buffer. They are identified throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> by the prefix "NB" at the end of the landscape name, or preceding the file type. "NB" indicates "No Buffer". For example, an old landscape that used to be named "Light Thin Pile Burn All" now appears as "Light Thin Pile Burn All-NB" and is identified as an "NB Landscape" in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MyWorkspace/NoBufferLandscapes.png" alt="Landscape names ending in 'NB' do not have a buffer around them" class="border" />
        </p>
        <h3>Buffering and Reports</h3>
        <p>The buffer around your landscape (the area outside the blue landscape boundary) <em>IS&#160;NOT</em> included in summary report statistics (such as Auto97th LFB reports) generated in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Only the area inside the landscape boundary is included in reports.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/buffer_inclusion.png" alt="only the area within the green boundary is included in reports" class="border" />
        </p>
        <h3>Editing Buffered Landscapes</h3>
        <p>Edits are applied to your landscape as well as this buffer area, including landscape edits and edits constrained by a mask. However, note that reports generated for your landscape only include the area inside the blue landscape boundary. If an Area of Interest (AOI) is used in generating a report, only the region of the AOI  that intersects the landscape area is analyzed and included in the report.</p>

        <h2>About LCP files in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p>It is important to know that canopy cover, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, stand height in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> refer to <span class="Emphasis">Forest canopy</span> characteristics. If you are working in an area classified as shrub or grass by LANDFIRE, your cover and base height values are zero. However, when you export LCP&#160;data from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you have additional layers available including, the Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC) and Existing Vegetation Height (EVH) layers. These layers will reflect cover and height data for tree, shrub, and herb lifeforms.</p>
        <p>There can still be confusing cases, as illustrated by the examples below:</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Example:&#160;No canopy cover in an area I&#160;know contains trees</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Southern New Jersey Coastal Pitch Pine Barrens:</b>
                </p>
                <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the stand height for much of this area is listed as zero, why are the trees not shown? Exporting the .LCP&#160;and examining it in Arcmap, there is an EVH reporting much of the area as pine barrens. However, the EVT for much of the area is classified as a non-forested fuel type. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/GetStarted/lcp_Pinebarren_ex.jpg" class="border" alt="EVT, EVH, and Stand Height maps shown for the same area." />
                </p>
                <p>Based on the map zone, EVT, and very short tree heights, this area was classified as a shrub fuel type, which makes sense from a fire behavior perspective, but can be confusing from a vegetative perspective.</p>
                <p>

                <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, much of the area is mapped as Fuel Model 122, a brush fuel model. However, there are stand heights of 7.5 meters, and in some places 17.5 meters. Zooming into the imagery base layer reveals that the area does indeed have some trees with associated stand heights. However, the brush fuel model appears correct from a fire behavior standpoint.</p>
                <p>

        <h2>Editing Considerations</h2>
        <p>Landscape features are not dependent upon each other when editing. When editing an LCP with User Created Edit Rules, changing one feature such as Fire Behavior Fuel Model, will not make changes to other features such as canopy height cover, etc. For example, changing a Timber Understory Fuel Model to a Grass Fuel Model will change the Fuel Model, but all the timber canopy features will remain until you edit them as well.</p>
        <h2>Landscape Terminology in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p>There are only two types of landscapes in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, unedited or edited. However, there are a variety of terms that reference these different landscape types depending on how they are being used. We will outline them below: </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Some terms are not mutually exclusive.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Starting Landscape</h3>
        <p><b><a name="Starting_Landscape"></a>Starting Landscape:</b> Any landscape chosen as the starting point for a landscape editing session. This term is used for both edited and unedited landscapes, and you will often see it next to the landscape drop-down menu when you begin edits in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. In the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Edit</span> task of <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span>, any landscape may be chosen as a starting landscape. In the landscape editing portion of the <span class="UIcomponent">Develop Treatment Alternatives</span> task of <span class="UIcomponent">Strategic Planning</span> session, the starting landscape choices will be limited to landscapes that match the geographic extent of the Originating landscape (explained below).</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Not sure if you're looking at an edited or unedited landscape?&#160;You can determine if editing rules have been applied by selecting the landscape in question from  <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> View and then clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">view edit rules</span> button.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Extracted Unedited Landscape (LANDFIRE)</h3>
        <p><b><a name="Extracted_Unedited_Landscape"></a>Extracted Unedited Landscape (LANDFIRE):</b> Thirty meter (30m) resolution raw “out of the box” landscape data extracted from LANDFIRE that have not yet been edited. This is the landscape that you first create, specifying the size and name. These are the only landscapes available to choose from in <span class="UIcomponent">Develop Treatment Alternatives</span> when you are prompted to “Pick Landscape”. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will always retain this original version under the name you have chosen.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Extracted Unedited Landscape  Recommended Naming Convention:</p>
            <p>Use a name that reflects geographic extent or Project Area Name  eg. Gumdrop Falls State Park, Horse Ridge, etc. Append the name  with data source if desired, eg. LFXXXX where XXXX represents the source year. (In the future more versions/years of LANDFIRE data are likely to become available).</p>
            <p>An example would be Gumdrop State Park LF2012 or Horse Ridge LF2012</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Edited (Alternative)&#160;Landscape</h3>
        <p><b><a name="Edited_(Alternative)_Landscape"></a>Edited (Alternative) Landscape:</b> New landscape saved during a landscape editing session where an edit rule has been applied, such as edits made to create an Existing Condition (EC)(defined below) or to reflect post-treatment conditions that would result from a fuel treatment alternative. You may check to see if editing rules have been applied to a landscape by selecting the landscape in question from  <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> View and then clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">view edit rules</span> button.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Edited Landscape Recommended Naming Convention:</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Existing Condition" />Existing Condition <MadCap:keyword term="EC" />(EC) Landscape</h3>
        <p><b><a name="Existing_Condition_(EC)_Landscape"></a>Existing Condition (EC) Landscape:</b> A term used specifically in Developing Treatment Alternatives, it refers to a landscape that represents, as closely as possible, the current condition of your landscape. It may be an edited landscape, or unedited. Extracted unedited landscapes can  be used to represent  EC if you determine the raw LANDFIRE data is current and accurate for your analysis purposes.  You will see this term used when comparing treatment alternatives in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Existing Condition Recommended Naming Convention:</p>
            <p>"Horse Ridge LF 2012"  (if extracted, unedited LANDFIRE data is used you will not have the opportunity to rename this landscape but you can still uses it to represent the Existing Condition.</p>

        <p><b><a name="Originating_Landscape_(Zero_“0”_landscape)"></a>Originating Landscape (Zero “0” landscape):</b> A term used specifically in Developing Treatment Alternatives, it refers to the unedited landscape you select to begin developing treatment alternatives. It will be tagged with a zero <img src="../../Resources/Images/DTA/zero.png" alt="zero icon indicating 'landscape zero' as defined in the help text" />icon. It defines the extent of your comparison, so any landscapes that match the extent of your originating landscape will become available during Developing Treatment Alternative task. </p>
