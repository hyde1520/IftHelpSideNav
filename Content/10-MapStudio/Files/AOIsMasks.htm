            <MadCap:keyword term="Mask" />Areas of Interests (AOIs) and Masks in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> you will encounter several terms that are applicable to <a href="ShapefileInfo.htm" target="_blank">shapefiles</a> or shapes, including "area of interest", "landscape mask", and "polygons". These terms all describe shapefiles or shapes, but are used in different tasks to reflect the terminology common to those tasks in the wildland fire community. Here is a brief overview of how these terms are used in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p><b>Shapefile vs. Shape?</b>
            </p>
            <p>"Shapefiles" include both the geometric area, as well as accompanying data, these can be uploaded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> from your local machine, and are usually created in ArcMap and similar tools.</p>
            <p>"Shapes" include only the geometric area, no associated data. These are created in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> either by drawing or copying with <span class="UIcomponent">Create / Edit Shapes</span>. </p>

        <h2>Where can you use an AOI in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />?</h2>
        <p>You can constrain your analysis with an AOI in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../../30-Tasks/Summaries/LandSummaryAbout.htm" target="_blank">Automatic 97th Percentile Landscape Fire Behavior (Auto97th LFB) Reports</a>
            </li>
            <li>LCP and Modeling <a href="../../20-Models/LFB/AOIlandscapefb.htm" target="_blank">summary reports from <span class="UIcomponent">My&#160;Workspace</span>.</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditAbout.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Editing</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="../../30-Tasks/DevTrtAlts/TrtmtAltsCompareLndscp.htm" target="_blank">Developing Treatment Alternatives (DTA)</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="../Functions/LandscapeTools.htm" target="_blank"><MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> Landscape Tools widget</a> - will generate a rectangular landscape around a selected AOI.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Area of Interest and Landscape Mask - Terminology in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Area of Interest</span> indicates that you can select a shapefile or shape to constrain your modeling or analysis to a specific area, such as a treatment unit. This term is used in the Landscape Summary and Determining Treatment Alternatives tasks.</p>
        <p>In the Editing Landscape task, you will see the term <span class="Emphasis">Landscape Mask</span> used. Landscape Mask will constrain your edits to a specific area.</p>
        <p>While we use different terms, <span class="Emphasis">Area of Interest</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Landscape Mask</span> function in the same way. Consider for example a scenario with a landscape called ‘Shady Basin’ and a treatment unit designated by a shapefile ‘Unit A’. In Editing, you would select Shady Basin as your landscape, and use Landscape Mask drop-down menu to constrain your edits to ‘Unit A’. In modeling fire behavior, you would select your edited landscape, and use the Area of Interest drop-down menu to constrain your modeling to Unit A.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Shapefile, Polygon, and Mask - Terminology in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude"><span class="Emphasis">Shapefile</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Shape</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Polygon</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Mask</span> are used in Map Studio to refer to shapefiles.</p>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Shapes:</span>: is used in the Layer List widget to indicate polygons, lines, and points created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Map Studio.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Shapefile</span>: Is used in the Shapefile Upload widget.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Polygons</span>: Is used in the Create/Edit Shapes widget.</li>
        </ul>
