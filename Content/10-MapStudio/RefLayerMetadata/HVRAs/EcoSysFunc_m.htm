        <p>Broad ecology and role of fire in ecosystems.  Derived from LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BpS, version 1.2.0) data.  Consolidated the XXXX BpS’ into 84 groupings based on ecological setting, historic fire frequency, and general fire ecology.  Then further lumped the data into 12 groups based on the response functions, or the effect of fire on each group.  Areas not mapped are non-burnable, sparsely vegetated, or represented by xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.</p>
