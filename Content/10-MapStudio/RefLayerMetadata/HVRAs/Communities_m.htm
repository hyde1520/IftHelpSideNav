        <h2>Brief summary</h2>
        <p>Communities represents population density classes based on Residentially Developed Populated Areas data (<a href="../../../41-References/Citations.htm#Haas_etal_2013" target="_blank">Haas and others 2013</a>). This dataset includes coverage for the conterminous US.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Communities is part of the Highly Valued Resources and Assets (HVRA) data used in the National Wildfire Risk Assessment for Forest Service Lands (NaWRA, <a href="../../../41-References/Citations.htm#DillonInPress" target="_blank">Dillon In Press</a>). Communities can be used as sub-HVRAs within the Map Values, Exposure Analysis and Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment functionality within the Interagency Fuel Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS, https://iftdss.firenet.gov).</p>
        <h3>Data Details</h3>
        <p>Communities represents population density classes based on Residentially Developed Populated Areas data (<a href="../../../41-References/Citations.htm#Haas_etal_2013" target="_blank">Haas and others 2013</a>).  RDPA was developed using the LandScan USATM population data (<a href="../../../41-References/Citations.htm#OakRidge_2008" target="_blank">Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 2008</a>) with some additional smoothing to conservatively identify pixels that are most likely to have people and residential structures located on them (<a href="../../../41-References/Citations.htm#Haas_etal_2013" target="_blank">Haas and others 2013</a>).  
RDPA was then classified into three population density classes using similar population density ranges to the Federal Register Wildland Urban Interface categorization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
Low density: &gt;0-28 people per square mile</li>
            <li>Medium density: &gt;28-250 people per square mile</li>
            <li>High density: &gt; 250 people per square mile</li>
        </ul>
