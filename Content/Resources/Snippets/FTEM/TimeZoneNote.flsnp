        <p>Note that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> and FTEM do not actively convert data to eastern time if it is imported. This has the potential to cause confusion, especially in FTEM,&#160;where fires from different sources may be brought into the system.</p>
        <p>For example, a fire that is discovered on July 1 at 2100 eastern daylight time will have a discovery time in IRWIN&#160;of July 2, 0100 GMT. However, when this data is pulled into FTEM, the discovery day/time will remain July 2, 0100, it will not automatically be converted back to July 1 at 2100 eastern daylight time. In parts of FTEM where the time zone is not listed, this may cause confusion.</p>
