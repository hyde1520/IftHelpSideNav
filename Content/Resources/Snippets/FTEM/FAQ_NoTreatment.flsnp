        <p>Treatments are pulled into FTEM&#160;nightly from FACTS and NFPORS and must have the following attributes in the system of record:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For NFPORS data, the treatment must be NFP&#160;(National Fire Plan), or non-NFP.</li>
            <li>For FACTS data:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A treatment must be KP 3 or KP 6.</li>
                <li>Where duplicate SUIDs (Sub Unit ID) exist, the SUID with the most recent completion date (ActualCompletionDate) will be chosen.</li>
                <li>If completion date (ActualCompletionDate) is also duplicated, treatments will be filtered by the the Treatment Category (treatment_category) in this order: 1-Fire, 2-Mechanical, 3-Other, 4-Preparation for Treatment.</li>
                <li>If Treatment Category is also duplicated, treatments will be filtered by FACTS Activity Code by choosing the smallest numerical code in the remaining duplicate SUIDS.</li>
                <li>If FACTS Activity Code is duplicated, no further filtering will be applied and remaining treatments will be brought in to FTEM.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>If your treatment meets the above criteria but is still not visible in the FTEM Treatment list:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Try increasing your search buffer for interacting treatments. This is done after you select your wildfire, but using the Add Treatments button on the Treatments tab. See the <a href="../../../10-FTEM/General/SearchBuffer.htm" target="_self">Search Buffer Topic</a> for a step by step walk-through of how to do this.</li>
            <li>If the treatment is outside of the buffer area, you can <a href="../../../10-FTEM/General/AddTreatmentwMap.htm" target="_blank">add it using the Map</a>.</li>
            <li>If the above do not resolve this issue, you may need to follow up with your <a href="../../../10-FTEM/Guidance/AgencyLeads.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Agency Administrator</a> to have your treatment entered in the system of record. Individual agencies may upload records at different intervals.</li>
        </ol>
