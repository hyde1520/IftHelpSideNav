        <p>FTEM will continue to update treatment interactions for active fires, adding new interactions as the fire perimeter updates.  However, any treatments you manually added or removed will remain unchanged by these updates. You may continue to add or remove treatments manually as the perimeter updates, or choose to wait until fire growth ceases to do so.</p>
