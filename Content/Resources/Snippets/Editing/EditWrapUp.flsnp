        <p>The edited landscape is stored in the same folder in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> as the landscape it was derived from. Landscape edits may take a few minutes to process. Once edits are complete, the edited landscape will be available in drop-down menus throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> where-ever a landscape input is required.</p>
