        <h1>Landscape Evaluation - Fire Behavior</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Fire Behavior task of Landscape Evaluation navigates to <b><a href="../10-Playground/ModelsOverview.htm" target="_blank">Modeling Playground</a></b>. From there you can view and access a list of model runs or run new fire behavior models. Currently fire behavior models available include:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Models/ModelListPlygrnd.flsnp" />
        <p>The Modeling Playground allows you to experiment with various weather conditions, generating new runs or copying and altering existing runs. Use this part of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to validate whether landscape fuel parameters generate expected fire behavior model outputs based on your knowledge and experience. If landscape fire behavior model outputs do not seem accurate or depict the scenario that you are trying to simulate, landscape data can be modified in LANDSCAPE EDIT. Also experiment with "what if" weather scenarios.</p>
