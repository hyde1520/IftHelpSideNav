            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Wildfire point data is pulled nightly from the <a href="https://forestsandrangelands.gov/WFIT/applications/IRWIN/index.shtml" target="_blank">Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information </a> (IRWIN) system. If no perimeter has been loaded into NIFS by the GISS via the Hosted National Incident Feature service for your wildfire, you may only see an origin point or triangular polygon representing the location, regardless of the acreage.</p>
                <p>  

 

If you have a wildfire location and would like to analyze polygon data from your local machine when monitoring (i.e. if no perimeter is available), please see <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">Adding Shapefiles in FTEM</a>.</p>
                <p> For more detail see <a href="DataTechnical/Wildfires.htm" target="_blank">FTEM Wildfire Technical Documentation</a>.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><a name="wfperimeter"></a>To display correctly, the wildfire perimeter must be correctly entered into the system of record (NIFS), this includes having the correct IRWIN ID for the perimeter.</p>
                <p>Check your agency's system of record. Contact dispatch for local fires and the GISS or SITL for larger incidents and request the fire perimeter be added or corrected in the system of record.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p> No. The region you specify when you create your FTEM&#160;account  simply constrains the map extent you see when you first open FTEM. You are still free to scroll and search for fires/treatments anywhere on the FTEM&#160;map.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">The list of fires and interactions you see in FTEM&#160;is determined by the map area you are zoomed into. It includes all agency fires so that fires which burn onto and through your agency lands are accounted for.</p>

                <p class="comment">DUPLICATE - NEED TO REMOVE</p>
                <p>The wildfire Data is pulled from IRWIN for points and NIFS for perimeters.  If no perimeter has been loaded in NIFS for your wildfire, you will only see a point representing it, regardless of the acreage. You can temporarily upload a perimeter for viewing purposes if you have one available (details in this are available in <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">Adding shapefiles in FTEM</a>.)</p>
                <p>Please see the <a href="DataTechnical/Wildfires.htm" target="_blank">Wildfire Technical Documentation</a> for more detail.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>FTEM gets fire data through IRWIN, which gathers fire data from FireCode, WildCAD, Sit/209, and WFDSS.  Currently FIRESTAT, the final fire reporting system for the USFS, is "read-only" for IRWIN data, which means that changes made in FIRESTAT do not propagate back into IRWIN. Thus, fire data in FTEM may not reflect the same values seen in the FIRESTAT application.  Efforts are underway to have Forest Service final fire reports reflected in IRWIN within the next year or two.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The new treatments will be available once in FTEM for users to add manually but the auto detect system will not pick them up once a fire has had monitoring started on it. So if you are missing treatments or think they have been updated in the system, you must select them on the map and add them from there or choose the add treatments button in the treatments tab to add them.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For FTEM monitoring, each agency will enter data on their own treatments. </p>
                <p>If you find it helpful, you may view different agency treatment layers using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add layers </span><img src="../Resources/Images/MapStudio/widget_icons/button_adref.png" alt="add layers" class="iftbutton" /> widget when in the map view.</p>
                <p>For those generating FTEM&#160;reports, the reports for all agencies will be available once the monitoring is completed.</p>
                <h3>If you need an FTEM&#160;role for more than one agency:</h3>
                <p>Request access to more than agency role from your FTEM&#160;User Profile. Each role must be approved by a FTEM Agency Lead. To see the full details on how to do this, see the <a href="AccountsRoles/AccountSetup.htm#FTEMRoleChange" target="_blank">Updating your User Role</a> section of FTEM&#160;Accounts.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>A wildfire where FTEM has been completed can be updated or edited.  Once you locate your fire in FTEM, go to the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete</span> tab and select <span class="UIcomponent">Amend</span>.  Provide a simple justification for the change into the pop-up box and you will be able to make any necessary adjustments.</p>

                <p>Specifying your region or unit when creating an FTEM&#160;account does not affect your access to wildfire data.</p>
                <p>FTEM uses your region/unit in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The region is used to determine which region of the United States to display in map view when you open an FTEM&#160;monitoring session. You may still zoom in, zoom out, or scroll to any other region of the map.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The region determines who your FTEM Administrator is. If you request changes in your FTEM&#160;role, an FTEM Administrator for your region will be notified to review the request. Support desk agents may also view the region listed on your account if they need to find an alternate FTEM Administrator to review your request (for example if your usual FTEM&#160;Administrator is away on assignment or otherwise unavailable).</p>

                <p>To permanently add a shapefile for a fire or treatment you'll need to update the systems of record FTEM&#160;uses (FACTS or NFPORS for treatments, IRWIN or NIFS for wildfires).</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Local Times? I understand the wildfire data comes in from IRWIN. The start times for my wildfires in AZ seem to be in Greenwich Mean Time and are 7 hours ahead. The Control, Contain, and Out times are all 5 hours ahead. Will that be changed to reflect local times?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
