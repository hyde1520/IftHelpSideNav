                <p>Wildfire point data is pulled nightly from the <a href="https://forestsandrangelands.gov/WFIT/applications/IRWIN/index.shtml" target="_blank">Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information </a> (IRWIN) system. If no perimeter has been loaded into NIFS by the GISS via the Hosted National Incident Feature service for your wildfire, you may only see an origin point or triangular polygon representing the location, regardless of the acreage.</p>
                <p>  

 

If you have a wildfire location and would like to analyze polygon data from your local machine when monitoring (i.e. if no perimeter is available), please see <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">Adding Shapefiles in FTEM</a>.</p>
                <p> For more detail see <a href="DataTechnical/Wildfires.htm" target="_blank">FTEM Wildfire Technical Documentation</a>.</p>

                <p><a name="wfperimeter"></a>To display correctly, the wildfire perimeter must be correctly entered into the system of record (NIFS), this includes having the correct IRWIN ID for the perimeter.</p>
                <p>First, check your agency's system of record. Contact their <a href="Guidance/AgencyLeads.htm" target="_blank">FTEM Agency Lead</a> if the fire has been listed in the system of record for over 24 hours but is not visible in FTEM.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p> When you create your FTEM&#160;account you will be asked to specify a region. This does not limit the treatments or wildfires you see. Your region simply constrains the map extent you see when you first open FTEM. You are still free to scroll and search for fires/treatments anywhere on the FTEM&#160;map.</p>
                <p>The list of fires and interactions you see in FTEM&#160;is determined by the map area you are zoomed into. It includes all agency fires so that fires which burn onto and through your agency lands are accounted for.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The wildfire Data is pulled from IRWIN for points and NIFS for perimeters.  If no perimeter has been loaded in NIFS for your wildfire, you will only see a point representing it, regardless of the acreage. You can temporarily upload a perimeter for viewing purposes if you have one available (details in this are available in <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">Adding shapefiles in FTEM</a>.)</p>
                <p>Please see the <a href="DataTechnical/Wildfires.htm" target="_blank">Wildfire Technical Documentation</a> for more detail.</p>

                <p> <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/FAQ_OngoingFires.flsnp" /> For example, if you manually remove a treatment interaction, and the fire later burns into that treatment, you will have to add the treatment again using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add&#160;Treatment</span> button. For this reason, we recommend waiting to monitor small to medium sized fires until they have been contained or declared "out."</p>
                <p>Aside from this aspect, the <a href="General/UsingFtem.htm" target="_blank">process of monitoring</a> an ongoing fire is the same as that fires that are out of contained.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>FTEM gets fire data through IRWIN, which gathers fire data from FireCode, WildCAD, Sit/209, and WFDSS.  Currently FIRESTAT, the final fire reporting system for the USFS, is "read-only" for IRWIN data, which means that changes made in FIRESTAT do not propagate back into IRWIN. Thus, fire data in FTEM may not reflect the same values seen in the FIRESTAT application.  Efforts are underway to have Forest Service final fire reports reflected in IRWIN within the next year or two.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The new treatments will be available once in FTEM for users to add manually but the auto detect system will not pick them up once a fire has had monitoring started on it. So if you are missing treatments or think they have been updated in the system, you must select them on the map and add them from there or choose the add treatments button in the treatments tab to add them.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For wildfires with an associated perimeter, any treatment that enters that perimeter is displayed.</p>
                <p>For wildfires represented by a point, a circle with its center at the wildfire’s point of origin is used to determine the potential treatment interactions for a wildfire.  The radius of the circle is based upon calculating the length of an ellipse whose length is 1.5 times its width and whose area is equal to the size of the wildfire.  The radius of the circle equals the length of the ellipse.</p>
                <p>If a wildfire is represented by both a point and a perimeter, the FTEM application will use the perimeter buffer regardless of the buffer type,  it is up to the user to determine which treatments to move to the monitor tab within the FTEM application.</p>
                <p>To search and add treatments from a wider area, refer to the topics on <a href="General/SearchBuffer.htm" target="_blank">adding treatments with the Add Treatment button</a>, or <a href="General/AddTreatmentwMap.htm" target="_blank">adding treatments using the map</a>.</p>

                <p>This question most often comes up when a wildfire shows up in FTEM as "Check for interactions" (displayed in a red color), but the person monitoring knows no treatments interacted or need monitoring.</p>
                <p>In this case you'll need to  remove the treatments so that the fire appears with  "No Interactions Detected", rather than "Check for interactions." To do this:</p>

                <h3>Wildfire Data</h3>
                <p>wildfire point data are imported into FTEM via IRWIN (Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information), a service that acts as a real time conduit for fire data between the various wildland fire applications. wildfire perimeter data are pulled from NIFS (Geospatial Multi Agency Coordination), an application that is updated daily based upon input from incident intelligence sources. The FTEM&#160;Application is updated daily to incorporate fires reaching controlled status from Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN)&#160;and NIFS. For more information, see the <a href="DataTechnical/TechDoc.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Technical Documentation</a>.</p>
                <h3>Treatment Data</h3>
                <p>The FTEM process relies on geospatial Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels treatment Layers that depict completed fuels treatments from four land management Agencies within the Department of Interior (National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs) as well as the US Forest Service. The FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels treatment Layers are derived from data stored in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Hazardous Fuels Reduction (HFR) Module of the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS). NFPORS is the national system for tracking fuels accomplishments for all agencies in the Department of Interior.</li>
                    <li>The Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS). FACTS is the official system for tracking U.S. Forest Service fuels accomplishments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more information, see the <a href="DataTechnical/TechDoc.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Technical Documentation</a>.</p>
                <h3>Once you enter data into FTEM...</h3>
                <p>FTEM data is summarized and analyzed at multiple levels and across various scales to demonstrate the utility of the Hazardous Fuels Reduction program for all interested entities including, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, Program Managers, Interest groups, and the public.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Requirement</span>. Anytime a wildfire starts in or interacts with a fuel treatment area, all agencies require that the outcome is documented to examine whether the treatment had the desired effect of reduced fire behavior and/or provided opportunities to firefighters for effective management of the wildfire (2017 Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations “<a href="../41-References/Citations.htm#NWCG2018" target="_blank">Red Book</a>”). The FTEM application provides the framework for documenting these outcomes consistently across agencies in a manner that demonstrates the utility of the Hazardous Fuels Reduction program for all interested entities including, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, Program Managers, Interest groups, and the public.</p>
