        <h1>About Selecting Treatments</h1>
        <p>The treatment list for a fire lists all the interactions for that fire.  You can think of this treatment selection step as the "shopping cart" where you place the treatments that require monitoring, and remove the ones that don't.</p>
        <p>&#160;The basic steps of selecting populating the treatment list include:</p>

                <p>The Treatment list for a fire is shared by all agency personnel monitoring the fire, you may need to collaborate with monitors from adjacent units to make sure you do not remove treatments others will need to monitor.</p>

                <p>Note the colored icons to the left of the treatment names. In this example the polygon icons <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly.png" alt="polgygon" /> indicate these treatments are polygons, and their red color indicates monitoring/data entry for them has not been started.

        <h2>Where Treatment Data Comes From and How Often it Updates</h2>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">From our treatment data page, the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; were a blue notice</p>
        <p>Treatment dates contained within FTEM vary by their source and include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>FACTS treatments completed after Jan. 1 2005.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>NFPORS treatments completed during or after 2008.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All other treatments completed less than ten years ago.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Source</h3>
        <p>Treatments in FTEM&#160;come from the FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers which is derived from data stored in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS) Hazardous Fuels Reduction (HFR) Module. NFPORS is the national system for tracking combined fuels accomplishments for all agencies in the Department of Interior.</li>
            <li>The Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS). FACTS is the official system for tracking USDA Forest Service fuels accomplishments. FACTS data is shared with NFPORS to facilitate interagency reporting needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Timing</h3>
        <p>Treatment data is pulled into FTEM nightly.</p>
        <h2>Incorrect Treatment Data</h2>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">From new incorrect treatment page</p>
        <p>Incorrect treatments in FTEM are usually caused by error in the data sources FTEM&#160;pulls from. </p>
        <p>Treatments <span class="Emphasis">cannot </span> be corrected in FTEM but must be corrected in the systems FTEM pulls from, either IRWIN or NIFS. </p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>To correct a treatment, contact your GIS&#160;Specialist to update the information in FACTS or NFPORS. The correction will then be pulled into FTEM&#160;with 24 hours of the update.</p>
