        <h1>About Monitoring</h1>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p> Active Fires - If you are monitoring a fire that is currently in progress, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will retain  your  interaction data entry as the fire continues to grow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p><a name="completionnote"></a>Note that even when monitored treatments appear completed, indicated by a green point <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_nointeraction.png" alt="point" class="iftbutton" /> or polygon <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_nointeraction.png" alt="polygon" class="iftbutton" /> symbol, the wildfire is not  completed until are interactions for a given agency are monitored and submitted by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete Wildfire Monitoring</span> button in the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete</span> tab. </p>

        <h2>Basic Steps</h2>
        <p>Basic monitoring steps include:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/TutorialSteps/Monitor_A.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/TutorialSteps/Monitor_B.flsnp" />
                <div class="notificationTip">
                    <p>By using the check box for one or more treatment, you may choose to enter data for treatments individually, or in batches. Note that when running batches, some fields will still need to be revisited and filled individually for each treatment such as time of burn and acres burned.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/TutorialSteps/Monitor_C.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/TutorialSteps/Monitor_D.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/TutorialSteps/Monitor_E.flsnp" />
                <div class="notificationTip">
                    <p>Note that in the image below two of three treatments are selected for data entry. You can choose to "batch" enter the same data for a selected set of treatments, but some fields such as time and acreage still need to be revisited and filled individually. You may find this approach useful if multiple treatments were involved in the same interaction.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/TutorialSteps/Monitor_F.flsnp" />

        <h2>Monitoring Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Monitoring can be done individually or as batch. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Batch monitoring requires you check several boxes in the Monitoring tab, then proceed to monitor that set of a treatments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Batch monitoring will leave the time and acreage fields blank, these must still be entered manually for each treatment before it can be fully completed.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
