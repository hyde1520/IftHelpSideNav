        <p>The FTEM mapping features consist of either points, or polygons. These are color coded to indicate the status of the treatment documentation in FTEM as either completed, in-progress, or not started. Similar symbology is also used when viewing FTEM data as a list. Below we list each of the symbols used in FTEM:</p>
        <h2>Map Symbols</h2>
        <h3>Treatment Point Interactions</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_complete.png" alt="treatment point completed" /> Completed: All required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_inprogress.png" alt="treatment point in progress" /> In Progress: Some required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_notstarted.png" alt="treatment point not started" /> Not Started: No required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_nointeraction.png" alt="treatment point none detected" /> No Interactions Detected: The system did not auto-detect the treatment as interacting with a wildfire.</p>
        <h3>Treatment Polygon Interactions</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_complete.png" alt="completed" /> Completed: All required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_inprogress.png" alt="in-progress" /> In Progress: Some required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_notstarted.png" alt="not started" /> Not Started: No required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_nointeraction.png" /> None Detected: The system did not auto-detect the treatment as interacting with a wildfire.</p>
        <h2>Table Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/ellipsis.png" alt="ellipsis" /> Monitoring for a treatment interaction not started</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/completesymbol.png" alt="monitoring completed" /> Treatment interaction has been monitored.</p>
