        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>The Treatment list for a fire is shared by all agency personnel monitoring the fire, you may need to collaborate with monitors from adjacent units to make sure you do not remove treatments others will need to monitor.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>What "Remove a Treatment" Does</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Removing treatments does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> delete them from FTEM, it simply removes the treatments from the interaction list for that specific fire.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Treatments you remove in this manner will remain removed from that fire, even as the fire perimeter grows and other treatments are auto-populated for that fire.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Treatments may be added back to a fire by using the Add Treatments button. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
