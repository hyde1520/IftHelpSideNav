        <h1>Monitoring Interface</h1>
        <p>The FTEM interface walks you through the treatment monitoring process. Use the tabs to select a wildfire, select your treatments, enter monitoring data, and review and complete your monitoring. Below, we walk through each stage of this process. The following steps assume you have an FTEM account. If not, visit the <a href="../AccountsRoles/AccountSetup.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Setup</a> topic for instructions. Upon opening FTEM, you will see wildfires with a split view of Map Studio on the left, and a table view on the right.</p>
        <h2>FTEM Interface Controls</h2>
        <p>Each button and tab in the FTEM&#160;interface is labeled below:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>If you only see two tabs, you have Viewer role, and must <a href="../AccountsRoles/Roles_Intro.htm#requestrole" target="_blank">request an Editor role</a> from your FTEM&#160;profile to access the <span class="UIcomponent">Monitoring</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">Complete</span> tabs.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_InterfaceAsViewer.png" alt="viewer roles see wildfire and treatment tabs" class="border" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>By default, the interface is split, displaying a map on the left, and monitoring tabs on the right. Change the interface at anytime to show only the tabs or only the map by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">split screen <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_ArrowButtons.png" alt="arrows" class="iftbutton" /> buttons</span> in the top of the screen just below the top navigation menu. Splitting the screen to only focus on the tabs also reveals a right hand panel displaying metadata, as shown below:</p>
