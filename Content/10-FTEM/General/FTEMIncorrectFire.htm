        <p>Incorrect fires in FTEM are usually caused by error in the data sources FTEM&#160;pulls from. </p>
        <p>Fires <span class="Emphasis">cannot</span> be corrected in FTEM but must be corrected in the systems FTEM pulls from, either IRWIN or NIFS. </p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>To correct a fire, contact your GIS&#160;Specialist to update the information in IRWIN or NIFS. The correction will then be pulled into FTEM&#160;with 24 hours of the update.</p>
