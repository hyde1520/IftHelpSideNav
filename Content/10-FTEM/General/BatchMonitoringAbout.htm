        <h1>About Batch Monitoring</h1>
        <p>Batch monitoring allows you to populate a spreadsheet with monitoring data for one or more wildfires and upload that data to FTEM.</p>
        <p>There are two methods of batch monitoring depending on how you choose to narrow your wildfire list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>From the monitoring interface</b>: Change the map extent until the Wildfire list reflects the fires you need to monitor, then generate a fillable spreadsheet to monitor those fires.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>From the reporting interface</b>:&#160;Use a series of report filters to  generate a fillable spreadsheet to monitor those fires.</p>
