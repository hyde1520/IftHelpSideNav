                <p>When the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete Wildfire Monitoring</span> button is grayed out, there are still treatments unmonitored for your agency. To make the button active, you either need to finish monitoring treatments for your agency in the monitoring tab, remove treatments that did not interact with the fire in the Treatments tab, or collaborate with personnel in your agency on adjacent units who still need to monitor their treatments.</p>
