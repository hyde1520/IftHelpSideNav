		<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
			<li>
				<p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Table Summary</span> button to generate a review table of treatments and data entered. You may also review attachments using the <span class="UIcomponent">Attachments</span> button. At this point, if you are satisfied with your treatment data, you may proceed to Step B. However, if you find a data entry that needs editing or additional information, you can use the tabs to navigate back, select treatments, and modify data.</p>
				<p>A list of "completed", "in progress", and "not started" treatments is displayed at the bottom of the page for your agency. If multiple agencies are involved, this is displayed for each agency.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete Wildfire Monitoring</span> button to submit your data to the FTEM System. The monitoring will be available in report queries from FTEM reporting.</p>

			<p>When the Complete Wildfire Monitoring button is grayed out, there are still treatments unmonitored for your agency. To make the button active, you either need to finish monitoring treatments for your agency in the monitoring tab, remove treatments that did not interact with the fire in the Treatments tab, or collaborate with personnel in your agency on adjacent units who still need to monitor their treatments.</p>
