        <h1>Selecting and Filtering Fires</h1>
        <p>Fires are automatically filtered by date and map extent when using FTEM.</p>
        <p>To further select wildfires use the Attribute Table in the map portion of FTEM:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Click the Attribute Table button in the bottom right of the map.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Options</span> and select <span class="UIcomponent">Filter</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Form a filter query to constrain the fires that appear. Start with creating a filter set so you can include a date constraint. This is needed because once you start filtering, the automatic date filter in FTEM&#160;is disabled.</p>
                <p>You can use the Protection Jurisdiction to filter your fires by individual forest, refuge, district etc? Need to look up the jurisdiction code for your area? Use the Jurisdiction Look-up Tool.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
