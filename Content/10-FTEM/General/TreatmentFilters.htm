        <h2><a name="Adding"></a>Adding or Removing Treatments</h2>
        <p>In FTEM, the treatment list is automatically populated for each wildfire based on <a href="../DataTechnical/Buffering.htm" target="_blank">interaction and buffering rules</a>. You can add treatments to this list by following the below steps:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatment(s)</span> button at the top of the treatment tab.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_AddTreatmentBuff.png" alt="use the 'add treatments' button to go to your treatment list" class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>In the dialogue box that appears replace the default buffer, in meters, with a wider buffer of your choosing.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Find Interactions</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_AddBufferDist.png" alt="specify a buffer distance in the popup box." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Any treatment interactions detected pop up as a list. Use the check boxes next to each interaction to select the ones you want. When finished, click <span class="UIcomponent">Add Selected Treatments</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_BufferAddInteraction.png" alt="select the desired treatments then add them to your treatment list" class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>In some cases, there may be quite a lot of interactions listed. The search box at the top of the list, and the page buttons at the bottom (Previous and Next)  help you narrow the list to find specific treatments.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To remove treatments from the list use the check boxes next to the treatments to select them, then click the <span class="UIcomponent">Remove Treatments</span> button. This removes the treatments from the interaction list for the fire; it does not delete the treatment data from the system. Removed treatments can be added back in by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatments</span> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_RemoveTreatment.png" alt="use the remove treatments button to remove selected treatments" class="border" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>The Treatment list for a fire is shared by all agency personnel monitoring the fire, you may need to collaborate with monitors from adjacent units to make sure you do not remove treatments others will need to monitor.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Filter"></a>Filter or Get More Information from the Treatment List</h2>
        <p>To filter your treatment list by interaction status, monitoring events, or treatment category, or to see the full metadata for a treatment, view the treatments tab in full screen view. This is done by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Hide map</span> button in the top center of the screen. Note that you can also filter the columns within the treatment in descending or ascending order by single left-clicking the column title.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_TreatmentRHPData.png" alt="hiding the map view shows more information about treatments" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Filter2"></a>Filter or Get More Information from the Map</h2>
        <p>Once you have zoomed into your area, you may want to further constrain the results with a specific filter term, or use some of the available FTEM&#160;Reference layers to aid in your monitoring. We'll cover these option here:</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Constraining the attribute table does not change the list that populates on the right of the screen until you use the "Zoom To" option to change the map extent.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Using a Filter in Attribute Table</h3>
        <p>For this example we will search for USFS Treatment Polygons associated with Fremont-Winema National Forest:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Attribute Table</span> button in the bottom right of the map.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_AttributeTable.png" alt="The 'Attribute Table' button on the bottom right of the map." class="borderlist" />
                    <br />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Use your mouse cursor to set the approximate extent of your treatment area, the attribute table automatically populates based upon visible map extent.</li>
            <li>Click the layer displayed along the top of the table that corresponds with your search, in this example "USFS Treatments: Poly Interactions" is selected.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Options</span> and select <span class="UIcomponent">Filter</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_att_table_Options.png" alt="use the filter option to further constrain your attribute table." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Create your filter expression and click <span class="UIcomponent">OK</span>. In this example we use "unit_name IS Fremont-Winema National Forest".<ul><li> You can use the Protection Jurisdiction to filter your fires by individual forest, refuge, district etc. </li><li>Need to look up the jurisdiction code for your area? Download the <a href="../../Resources/Supporting/UnitIdActive.csv" target="_blank">Jurisdiction Look-up CSV</a>.</li><li><p>This  constrains the table to attributes that match your search results. </p></li></ul><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_AddExpression.png" alt="Use the filter to create expressions to query the attribute table." class="borderlist" /></p></li>
            <li>
                <p>To zoom to a record, select it by clicking the gray area to the left of the attribute row and use the <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom To</span> option.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_att_table_TrtmntZoomTo.png" alt="select a record and click 'zoom to' to zoom to it on the map." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Viewing Treatments using Add Layers</h3>
        <p>Using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Layers</span> widget, you can turn on specific&#160;Agency's FTEM&#160;Treatment Polygons or Points. This adds them to the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and makes it easier to see on the map. In the example below "USFS&#160;FTEM&#160;Treatment Polys" is selected in <span class="UIcomponent">Add Layers</span>, and is displayed in <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>. You can see the bright green polygons clearly visible on the map.</p>
        <p>

        <h2><a name="Add"></a>Add Missing Treatments or Correct Treatment Data</h2>
        <h3>Add a Missing Treatment</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/FTEM/FAQ_NoTreatment.flsnp" />
        <h3>Correct&#160;Treatment Data</h3>
        <p>Treatments are pulled into FTEM&#160;nightly from FACTS and NFPORS. If treatment data is incorrect, please work with your <a href="../Guidance/AgencyLeads.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Agency Administrator</a> to have your treatment data corrected in the appropriate system.</p>
