        <h2><a name="Filter"></a>Filter or Get More Information from the Treatment List</h2>
        <p>To filter your treatment list by interaction status, monitoring events, or treatment category, or to see the full metadata for a treatment, view the treatments tab in full screen view. This is done by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Hide map</span> button in the top center of the screen. Note that you can also filter the columns within the treatment in descending or ascending order by single left-clicking the column title.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="Filter2"></a>Filter or Get More Information from the Map</h2>
        <p>Once you have zoomed into your area, you may want to further constrain the results with a specific filter term, or use some of the available FTEM&#160;Reference layers to aid in your monitoring. We'll cover these option here:</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Constraining the attribute table does not change the list that populates on the right of the screen until you use the "Zoom To" option to change the map extent.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Using a Filter in Attribute Table</h3>
        <p>For this example we will search for USFS Treatment Polygons associated with Fremont-Winema National Forest:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Attribute Table</span> button in the bottom right of the map.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_AttributeTable.png" alt="The 'Attribute Table' button on the bottom right of the map." class="borderlist" />
                    <br />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Use your mouse cursor to set the approximate extent of your treatment area, the attribute table automatically populates based upon visible map extent.</li>
            <li>Click the layer displayed along the top of the table that corresponds with your search, in this example "USFS Treatments: Poly Interactions" is selected.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Options</span> and select <span class="UIcomponent">Filter</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_att_table_Options.png" alt="use the filter option to further constrain your attribute table." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Create your filter expression and click <span class="UIcomponent">OK</span>. In this example we use "unit_name IS Fremont-Winema National Forest."<ul><li> You can use the Protection Jurisdiction to filter your fires by individual forest, refuge, district etc. </li><li>Need to look up the jurisdiction code for your area? Download the <a href="../../Resources/Supporting/UnitIdActive.csv" target="_blank">Jurisdiction Look-up CSV</a>.</li><li><p>This  constrains the table to attributes that match your search results. </p></li></ul><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_AddExpression.png" alt="Use the filter to create expressions to query the attribute table." class="borderlist" /></p></li>
            <li>
                <p>To zoom to a record, select it by clicking the gray area to the left of the attribute row and use the <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom To</span> option.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/monitoring/FTEM_att_table_TrtmntZoomTo.png" alt="select a record and click 'zoom to' to zoom to it on the map." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Viewing Treatments using Add Layers</h3>
        <p>Using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Layers</span> widget, you can turn on specific&#160;Agency's FTEM&#160;Treatment Polygons or Points. This adds them to the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and makes it easier to see on the map. In the example below "USFS&#160;FTEM&#160;Treatment Polys" is selected in <span class="UIcomponent">Add Layers</span>, and is displayed in <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>. You can see the bright green polygons clearly visible on the map.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Correct&#160;Treatment Data</h3>
        <p>Treatments are pulled into FTEM&#160;nightly from FACTS and NFPORS. If treatment data is incorrect, please work with your <a href="../Guidance/AgencyLeads.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Agency Administrator</a> to have your treatment data corrected in the appropriate system.</p>
