        <h1>Generating and Viewing Reports</h1>
        <p>In <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, you may generate a summary report to assess landscape features and model outputs. Reports contain a variety of graphs and tables that can each be downloaded individually to use in your own documents. You may also choose to download the entire report as a PDF.</p>
