        <p>In <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, you may generate a summary report to assess landscape features and model outputs. Reports contain a variety of graphs and tables that can each be downloaded individually to use in your own documents. You may also choose to download the entire report as a PDF.</p>
        <h2>Generate a Report</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>From <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, click on a landscape or model output file to see the file options.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span> option. A report dialogue box will open.</p>

                <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span>. You may use the refresh button to check whether your report is ready. Reports may take several minutes to generate depending on file size.</p>
