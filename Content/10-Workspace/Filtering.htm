        <p>When you navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> you will see the All Content folder is open by default, displaying every file you have in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Display filters</span> in the top left to narrow the file list by file type, and the <span class="UIcomponent">Name Search</span> in the top to search by file name.</p>
