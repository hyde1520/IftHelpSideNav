        <h1>Getting Started:&#160;Landscape Editing</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> users often edit landscapes to better represent the conditions on their home unit, or to simulate landscape conditions after fuel treatments. Editing can be performed across the entire landscape, or limited to an area of interest using a shapefile you've uploaded, or a shape you've created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, as a mask. When you edit a landscape, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> retains your original landscape, and created a new copy containing your edits, this means your original landscape is always retained.</p>
        <p>There are two editing options in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Default Fuels Treatment/Disturbance Rules: Pre-existing rules built into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li>Add Landscape Edit Rules: Custom rules you create.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Make (some) Edits</h2>
        <p>Landscape editing often begins by selecting <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Edit</span> in the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape&#160;Evaluation stage</span> of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span>.</p>

        <p>The next steps are taken from the <a href="../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditAbout.htm" target="_blank">Editing Landscape Data</a> topic, please refer to it for full details, or to see how user-defined rules are created. We will use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Default Fuels Treatment/Disturbance Rules for this short example.</p>

        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>When clicking on landscape files that have been edited in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, you will see an option to <span class="UIcomponent">View Edit Rules</span>. This displays the edits that were made on that landscape.</p>
