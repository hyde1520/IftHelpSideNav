        <h1>Get Started:&#160;Shapefiles and Shapes</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Shapefiles and shapes are created or uploaded in Map Studio and are then made available throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> whenever a mask or area of interest is required. </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p><b>Shapefile vs. Shape?</b>
            </p>
            <p>"Shapefiles" include both the geometric area, as well as accompanying data, these can be uploaded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> from your local machine, and are usually created in ArcMap and similar tools.</p>
            <p>"Shapes" include only the geometric area, no associated data. These are created in Map Studio either by drawing or copying with <span class="UIcomponent">Create / Edit Shapes</span>. </p>
            <p>Both shapes and shapefiles may be used as masks and areas of interest throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></p>
        </div>
        <h2>How to Create Shapes in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p>This example will describe the creation of polygons, you may also create lines and points. To create a shape, go to <span class="UIcomponent">Map Studio</span> and click the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit/Create Shapes</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/MapStudio/widget_icons/button_editTools.png" alt="Edit Tools Button" class="iftbutton" /> widget.</p>

        <h2>How to Upload Shapefiles</h2>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p><a name="zipshapefiles"></a>Shapefiles are added to Map Studio as .zip files. The .zip file must contain the .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files that comprise the shapefile.</p>
