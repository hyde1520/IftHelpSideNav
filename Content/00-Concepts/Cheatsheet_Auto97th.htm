        <h1>Automatic 97th Percentile Landscape Fire Behavior (Auto97th LFB) Report</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Automatic 97th Percentile Landscape Fire Behavior (Auto97th LFB) Report will automatically run Landscape Fire Behavior across a landscape of your choosing, using 97th percentile fire weather conditions selected from  the closest Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS).</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>The RAWS selected, and the fuel moisture and wind scenario for the Auto97th LFB modeling, cannot be changed.  It is intended to be a starting point to understand your landscape and predicted fire behavior.  You may choose to run a <a href="../20-Models/LFB/About.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Fire Behavior</a> model run with user-input values in the <a href="../10-Playground/ModelsOverview.htm" target="_blank">Modeling Playground</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>How to Create an Auto97th LFB Report</h2>
        <p>Access the Landscape Summary task from the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span> stage of the <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Cycle/Cyl_LandEvalSummary.png" alt="auto97th summary card" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Specify an existing landscape to summarize using the drop-down menu. If you do not have a landscape yet use the <span class="UIcomponent">Create Here</span> or<span class="UIcomponent"> Create in Map Studio</span> buttons to <a href="../10-MapStudio/Files/LCPCreate.htm" target="_blank">create one</a>. Creating a landscape in Map Studio will require you to navigate back the Auto97th LFB Report interface when your landscape is created. Newly created landscapes may take a few minutes to generate. If you choose a newly created landscape that is still being created, it will have an hourglass icon <img src="../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/Icon_Hourglass.png" alt="hourglass icon" /> displayed after the landscape name; use the <span class="UIcomponent">Refresh</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/Btn_StatusRefresh.png" alt="Refresh_button" /> to the left of the drop-down field until the hourglass is replaced by a green checkmark <img src="../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/Btn_CheckMark.png" alt="checkmark icon" />, indicating your new landscape is ready. </li>
            <li>(Optional) Specify an area of interest (polygon or shapefile) within an existing landscape for summary. To run a summary across the entire landscape, leave this field blank.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span> button.</p>

            <li>
                <p>A prompt appears with the name of your landscape across the top. Click <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span> to generate the summary report.</p>

                <p>The <img src="../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/Icon_Hourglass.png" alt="hourglass" title="Hourglass icon" /> icon indicates the summary report is being generated.

                <p>When finished your Auto97th LFB Report will be available by clicking on the report name in the confirmation dialogue box.</p>

        <p>It may also be viewed from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, in the same folder as the landscape you chose to summarize, as well as listed in <span class="UIcomponent">Modeling Playground</span>. You may also view your report outputs in Map Studio by adding the fire behavior output via the <span class="UIcomponent">Simulation Output Tools</span> widget. All Auto97th model output files are easily identified by their file names which end with "- Auto97th."</p>
