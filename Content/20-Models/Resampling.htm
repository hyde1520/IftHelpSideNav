            <p>Resampling is the process of interpolating the pixel values while transforming your raster dataset. In IFTDSS, resampling is conducted to adjust the resolution of your landscape to allow it to successfully run in some modeling applications.</p>
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>Resampling is necessary in IFTDSS for the computational needs of the models. Resampling prior to calling the model improves performance because the models resample the landscape on the fly. Consequently, the models need to read the entire 30m landscape even when they are running at a coarser resolution. Thus, resampling the landscape prior to calling the model reduces memory consumption as well as reduces the amount of time it takes to run the model.</p>
            <p>The resampled landscape will be made available in My Workspace so you have access to the exact resampled landscape that is running the model. This is beneficial for understanding the underlying fuels/vegetation relating to the predicted fire behavior on each pixel.</p>
            <h2>When</h2>
            <p>Resampling only occurs for landscapes submitted for Landscape Burn Probability runs when they are larger than 250,000 ac, including the buffered area.</p>
            <div class="notificationTip">
                <p>Landscapes that have been resampled are easily identified in IFTDSS by the landscape name, which will have the resolution automatically added to the end. For example “LBP Ponderosa Flats-60m” indicates that file has been resampled to a 60m resolution. Model outputs run with resampled landscapes will also have the resolution automatically added to the end. For example “Ponderosa Flats Hot and Dry-60m”</p>
            </div>
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>Landscape resampling functions the same way in IFTDSS as it does in FlamMap. Specifically, the resampling algorithm does the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resampling starts from the upper left hand corner of the landscape.</li>
                <li>Uses the center cell – if the center cell is at the intersection of 4 cells, it selects the cell above and to the left of the intersection.</li>
                <li>If the center cell does not exist in the original landscape, no cell is generated for the resampled landscape. Thus, the size of the resampled landscape may be slightly larger or smaller than the original landscape.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Resampling resolution is based upon the size of your buffered landscape:</p>
