        <h1>Midflame Wind Speed</h1>
        <p> The speed of the wind measured at the midpoint of the flames, considered to be most representative of the speed of the wind that is affecting fire behavior. Fire behavior models calculate midflame windspeed from 20 foot winds using a wind reduction factor. In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, Landscape Fire Behavior and Landscape Burn Probability it is the wind velocity at the midflame height.</p>

        <p>

		In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> this is expressed in miles per hour in the Map Studio and download outputs. </p>
