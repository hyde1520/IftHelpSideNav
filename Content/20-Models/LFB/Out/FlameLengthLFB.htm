        <p>The flame length of a spreading surface fire within the flaming front is measured from midway in the active flaming combustion zone to the average tip of the flames. Flame length is an indicator of fireline intensity. </p>
        <p>

In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> this is expressed in feet in the Map Studio and reports, in the download it is in meters. </p>
