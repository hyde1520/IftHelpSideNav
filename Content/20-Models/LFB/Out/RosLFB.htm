        <p>Rate of spread is the relative activity of a fire in extending its horizontal dimensions. It is expressed as rate of forward spread of the fire front.</p>
        <p>When fire moves upslope, the fuel ahead of the flame front is closer to the flame than if the slope were flatter.  This set-up "preheats" the fuels. The effects of slope on fire spread become greater as the slope increases. </p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Conceptuals/Fig_SlopeRoS.jpg" alt="As fire burns uphill it drafts in fresh air and preheats fuels, increasing rates of spread. Burning embers may also roll down slope contributing to fire spread." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>

In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> this is expressed in chains per hour in the Map Studio and reports, in the download it is in meters per minute.</p>
