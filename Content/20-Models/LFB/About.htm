        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>One of the first stages in the landscape evaluation stage of landscape planning includes running a basic fire behavior model for your area. The Landscape Fire Behavior (LFB) model will create spatial outputs viewable in <a href="../../10-MapStudio/MapStudioAbout.htm" target="_blank">Map Studio</a> as well as summary reports. You can access the LFB model from the <a href="../../10-Cycle/LandEvalAbout.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Evaluation</a> stage of the Planning Cycle, as well as from <a href="../../10-Playground/ModelsOverview.htm" target="_blank">Modeling Playground</a>.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>The LFB model is the one that is automatically run when you create an Auto97th Landscape Summary.</p>

        <h2>Defining Landscape Fire Behavior</h2>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/widget_layer_list/LyrList_lfb_fl.png" alt="Landscape fire behavior outputs displayed in map studio" style="float: right;" />
        <p>Landscape Fire Behavior in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is <a href="TechDoc.htm" target="_blank">driven by FlamMap</a>. FlamMap  is a fire behavior mapping and analysis software application that computes potential fire behavior characteristics (<a href="Out/Output.htm" target="_blank">such as spread rate, flame length, and fireline intensity</a>) over an entire landscape under constant weather and fuel moisture conditions input by the user. </p>
        <h2>Why Create a Landscape Fire Behavior Model (LFB) Run</h2>
        <p>Landscape Fire Behavior outputs can be useful in prioritizing treatment areas. Model outputs can be viewed spatially in Map Studio or as summary reports. These model outputs are also used in the <a href="../../30-Tasks/DevTrtAlts/TrtmtAltsCompareLndscp.htm" target="_blank">Developing Treatment Alternatives</a> task in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <h2>Using the LFB model</h2>
        <p>To run an LFB model you will need to have <a href="../../30-Tasks/CreateLCP/LCPCreateAbout.htm" target="_blank">created a landscape</a> in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. You can run LFB on newly created landscapes as well as ones you've made <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditAbout.htm" target="_blank">edits to</a>. In addition to the landscape, you will provide the model with <a href="In/InOverviewLFB.htm" target="_blank">inputs describing fuel and moisture conditions</a>.</p>
