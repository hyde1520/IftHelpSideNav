        <p>On this page we will outline the step by step process of:</p>

        <h2><a name="Creating"></a>Creating a Landscape Fire Behavior run for geospatial display</h2>
        <p>The Landscape Fire Behavior modeling option can be reached in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> via My Modeling Playground, or the Landscape Evaluation Stage of the Planning Cycle (which will take you to <a href="../../10-Playground/ModelsOverview.htm" target="_blank">My Modeling Playground</a>). Once the Landscape Fire Behavior model is chosen from My Modeling Playground, follow these steps to populate and run the model:&#160;<a name="LFBPickLandscape"></a></p>

        <h2>Populate the Model Parameters and Run</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Models/LFB/LfbInputs.flsnp" />
        <p>To finish, give your run a descriptive name and select <span class="UIcomponent">Run</span> to run the model, or <span class="UIcomponent">Save</span> to save the inputs you've created and return to work later.</p>

        <h2>Model Completion</h2>
        <p>Once completed, Landscape Fire Behavior run outputs are available to be viewed in <span class="UIcomponent">Map Studio</span> using the <span class="UIcomponent">Simulation Output Tools</span> widget and clicking the model name from the list of completed model runs. You may also do this from <span class="UIcomponent">My&#160;Modeling Playground</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> by clicking on your file and selecting the <span class="UIcomponent">View on Map</span> option.</p>

        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>All saved runs are stored in the same folder as your selected landscape, or in the "Playground folder" if a new landscape is created but no folder specified.</p>

        <p>To see how to generate an Automatic 97th Percentile Landscape Fire Behavior (Auto97th LFB) Report for your landscape, visit <a href="../../30-Tasks/Summaries/Auto97PctlReportDocumentation.htm" target="_blank">Automatic 97th Percentile Landscape Fire Behavior (Auto97th LFB) Report Documentation</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Creating2"></a>Creating a Landscape Fire Behavior summary report for an Area of Interest</h2>
        <p>Once you have created a Landscape Fire Behavior modeling run, you have the option of creating a summary report from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>. Summary reports present your data in graphs and tables that may be easily copied over into your own planning documents and reports.</p>
        <p>The steps below outline how to do this for a specific area of interest. However, if you wanted to generate a report for the entire landscape you may do so by simply leaving the AOI field in the steps below blank.</p>
