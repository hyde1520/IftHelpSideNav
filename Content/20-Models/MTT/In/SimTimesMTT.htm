        <h1>Simulation Time</h1>
        <p>Simulation Time (burn period length) describes duration of worst case fire growth, in hours, for each fire simulated during a Landscape Fire Behavior run. Each fire simulated is modeled for the simulation time (burn period length) you specify here. For each fire, wind conditions, fuel moistures, and spotting probability you enter in the other input fields are held constant. Longer burn period lengths result in larger fires given all other conditions are unchanged.</p>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" />, the Burn Period Length selected can be 4 to 12 hours long.</p>
