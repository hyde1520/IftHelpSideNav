        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>LBP is intended to be used to gauge fuel treatment effectiveness, integrated hazard and/or wildfire risk. Inputs should represent the “worst case scenario” or “problem fire” conditions. Potential sources of initial fuel moistures, wind speed and wind direction could include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wind speed and wind direction calculated in Fire Family Plus from a local RAWS using historic weather from the past 10 to 20 years representing 90-97th percentile conditions.</li>
                <li>Wind speed and wind direction from a known ‘problem fire’ on a day of maximal growth.</li>
                <li>Predefined initial fuel moistures for very dry or dry conditions (<a href="" target="_blank">Scott and Burgan 2005</a>) in combination with known or predicted worst case scenario wind speed and wind direction.</li>
            </ul>
