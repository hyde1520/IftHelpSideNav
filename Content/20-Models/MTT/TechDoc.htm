        <h1>Minimum Travel Time (MTT) Fire Spread Technical Documentation</h1>
        <p><a href="https://firenet365.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/IFTDSS_Non_Gov/Shared Documents/General/IBM IFTDSS/IFTDSS Development/Help/Help Center/MTT/MTT General Tech Doc (MTT Fire Spread).docx?d=wd677bafcce0bb46ae548b75d77fe57a6&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=eudfJL" target="_blank">Draft</a>

        <p>Minimum travel time (MTT) Fire Spread is a two-dimensional fire growth 
 model (<a href="../../41-References/Citations.htm#Finney2002" target="_blank">Finney, 2002</a>). MTT calculates fire growth and behavior by searching 
 for the set of pathways with minimum fire spread times from point, line, 
 or polygon ignition sources. In theory, the results are identical to wave-front 
 expansion used in Farsite with the exception that all weather and fuel 
 moisture conditions are held constant over time with MTT but are allowed 
 to vary with time in Farsite.</p>
        <h2>Ignition</h2>
        <p>Specify your ignitions with an uploaded shapefile, or drawn shape from <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. Only a single file may be selected, but that file may contain several points or lines to indicate ignition.</p>
        <h2>Simulation Time</h2>
        <p>This specifies the duration (in hours), and the number of burn periods you want to represent. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to simulate a 5 hour burn period over one day, enter "5" in the Burn Period Length field, and "1" in the # Burn&#160;Periods field to represent one day. </li>
            <li>If you want to simulate a 5 hour burn period per day, for three days, enter a "5" in the Burn Period Length field, and "3" in the # Burn&#160;Periods field to represent three days.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">A "0" (zero) simulation time behaves differently depending 
 on the ignition type. Using a shapefile as the ignition indicates that 
 you want to run the simulation until all burnable nodes on the landscape 
 have "burned". On "slow" or large analysis areas or 
 with moderate weather conditions this can cause very long runtimes. </li>
        </ul>
