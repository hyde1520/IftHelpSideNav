            <p>MTT Embers is only available in the download package and is not displayed in Map Studio. </p>
        </div>
        <p>Embers is a shapefile contained in the Minimum Travel Time Fire Spread (MTT) download package. The shapefile shows where live embers landed. These locations are not necessarily where spot fires occur; an ember could land but not ignite the fuels.</p>

        <h2>Ember influence on Arrival Time</h2>
        <p>If an ember lands, the landing time is compared to the current <a href="ArrivalMTT.htm" target="_blank">arrival time</a>, the earlier time then becomes the arrival time. Any point can have it's arrival time replaced with a lower one regardless if the lower time is the result of another ember or surface fire spread.</p>
        <p>The following attribution is part of the MTT Ember shapefile:</p>

            <li>
                <p>LaunchY - Y coordinate of the live ember launch,</p>

            <li>
                <p>LaunchTime - simulation time (in minutes) when the live ember was lofted from a torching tree,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>LandTime - simulation time when the live ember landed (in minutes), plus any spotting delay (set to 0 minutes for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />).</p>
