        <p>Fireline intensity describes the heat energy released per unit time from a one-foot-wide (or one-meter-wide) section of the fuel bed extending from the front to the rear of the flaming zone. Fireline intensity is a function of rate of spread and heat per unit area, and is directly related to flame length.  In IFTDSS the units are in BTU/ft/sec in the Map Studio and reports, in the download it is kW/m.</p>

Rate of Spread is modeled for every cell.</p>

MTT versus LFB – Output Differences 
</h2>
        <p>Minimum Travel Time Fire Spread (MTT) Fireline Intensity outputs may not match Landscape Fire Behavior (LFB), there are several reasons for this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>

Fireline Intensity is specific to the direction the fire is spreading and can include heading, backing or flanking fire in MTT.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fireline Intensity is the maximum rate of spread (head fire) regardless of direction in LFB.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> 

Fireline Intensity is only calculated for areas that fire has burned in MTT.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

Fireline Intensity is calculated for every pixel on the landscape in LFB.
