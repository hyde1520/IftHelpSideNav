        <p>Choosing fuel moisture conditioning allows dead fuel moisture values for 1,10, and 100 hour fuels to be adjusted based on aspect, elevation, forest canopy cover, and weather over a set period of time. For example, you may want to conducting different LFB runs during day and night conditions. Fuel conditioning options in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> include:</p>
        <h2>Do Not Condition (Use Initial Fuel Moistures)</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not condition fuels, rather it uses the initial fuel moistures across the entire landscape.</p>
        <h2>Condition (Select a Classified Weather Stream)</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will condition dead fuel moistures using a classified weather stream. This option is available when you do not have weather data of your own to condition with. Currently, the only classified weather stream available represents near-maximum or “extreme” conditions. In the future more options will be available. For technical details on the “extreme” conditions, see the <a href="classifiedweather.htm" target="_blank">Classified Weather Stream Help Topic</a>.</p>
        <h2>Condition (Upload a  Weather Stream File)</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will condition dead fuel moistures based on a weather stream (WXS) file you upload, and a conditioning period (time of day and number of days) you choose. This option may be used when you have your own weather data (wxs file) and would like to ensure that the analysis scenario you are calculating captures the influence of landscape characteristics on fuel moisture at various times of day and year. For details on creating WXS files, see the <a href="AboutWXS.htm" target="_blank">.wxs Creation Help Topic</a>.</p>

        <h2>About Fuel Moisture Conditioning</h2>
        <p>Conditioning results in variation of dead fuel moistures across a landscape.  In areas where canopy cover is greater than zero are greater.  Elevation also impacts fuel moisture, areas higher than the RAWS location are greater, and those below are lower.</p>
        <p>Conditioning fuels results in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculating separate dead fuel moistures for each landscape cell based on the topography and shading from the forest canopy cover and clouds, as indicated in the table below:</p>

        <p>Regardless of your choice to use a classified weather stream, or a custom weather stream, the same algorithms are employed to condition dead fuel moisture based on fuel size. Calculations for dead fuel moistures are from FlamMap, which implements the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 hr fuel moisture in FlamMap is obtained from a calculation involving the equilibrium moisture content (<a href="../../41-References/ReferenceList.htm#Bradshaw1983" target="_blank">Bradshaw et al. 1983</a>).</li>
            <li>10 hr fuel moisture in FlamMap is calculated with relationships from <a href="../../41-References/ReferenceList.htm#Nelson2000" target="_blank">Nelson (2000)</a>.</li>
            <li>100 hr fuel moistures in FlamMap are calculated with modifications by <a href="../../41-References/ReferenceList.htm#Nelson2000" target="_blank">Nelson</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fuel Moisture Conditioning Period</h2>
        <p>The period during which fuel conditioning is applied, anywhere from 1 to 7 days. The  time of day is also required, which will have a significant influence on the fuel moistures. This is because the conditions affecting fuel moisture, such as relative humidity, can fluctuate significantly depending upon the time of day, as shown in the example below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Models/FMConditioning/hourly_fm_example.png" alt="fuel moisture graph showing daily flucations over several days, then zooming in to show fluctuations up and down throughout a 24 hour period." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning of a conditioning period, the dead fuels of all size classes in each fuel model will not reflect the influences of the local site conditions. Fuels for a particular fuel model will have the initial fuel moistures you populated within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. As the conditioning period progresses for a few hours or a day the moisture content of the finer fuels (1hr, 10hr) will increasingly reflect the local site conditions because of their short time-lag. Because the short time-lag fuels (1hr, 10hr) have the most influence on calculated fire behavior, conditioning periods longer than a few days do not change results significantly for similar weather streams. At the end of the conditioning period, the landscape will contain spatial variation in dead fuel moisture with less influence of the initial fuel moisture input conditions.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Conditioned fuel moistures represent fuel moisture variation spatially at one point in time. If you are comparing day and night conditions and using your own wxs file, you may set you conditioning period to a specific time of day</p>
