        <h1>Flow Paths Themes</h1>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.QA ONLY">Google Docs:&#160;https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nZsQz5rwxZMuZgeWX0mhk5yPkN2q3XOzyPL0FeLhZk/edit#heading=h.kt9snid3uqyl</p>
        <p>Flow path themes are the minimum travel time pathways between the user defined nodes. The density or spacing of the nodes is determined by the Resolution of Calculations setting on either the Minimum Travel Time or Treatment Optimization Model tabs. There are two flow path themes generated by MTT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Flow Paths:</b> This theme displays the minimum time pathways between all the nodes on the analysis area.</li>
            <li><b>Major Paths:</b> This theme is a subset of the  MTT Flow Paths item showing just the most significant fire spread pathways. The spacing of the  MTT Major Paths is determined by the Interval for Minimum Travel Paths (distance): setting on the Minimum Travel Time tab.</li>
        </ul>
