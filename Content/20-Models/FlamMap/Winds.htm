        <p>Fire behavior in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, driven by FlamMap, uses a 20 foot wind speed and direction at set point in time to calculate fire behavior. The calculations use midflame wind speed, which is derived from the 20 foot wind speed entered. For each cell in the landscape, a wind adjustment factor, based on canopy height and canopy cover, is applied to convert the 20 foot wind speed to a midflame wind speed.</p>
        <p>When calculating fire behavior there are four options for wind direction. Each option has its strength depending upon the circumstances:</p>
        <h2>Gridded Winds (a.k.a WindNinja)</h2>
        <p>Selecting Generate Gridded Winds  (<a href="../../41-References/ReferenceList.htm#USFS2018" target="_blank">USFS 2018</a>) uses WindNinja to compute spatially varying winds across your landscape based on topographic change as well as a drag effect that vegetation has on wind flow. All of the layers within the landscape file are used to determine the wind direction for each cell.</p>
        <p>Gridded wind direction is used to model complex terrain winds. For example, if you needed to take into account funneling in a narrow canyon.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Static Direction</h2>
        <p>Selecting Static Direction applies the same wind direction for every cell in the analysis area. IFTDSS uses the 20 foot wind direction you provide.</p>
        <p>This option would be most appropriate for modeling fire behavior on a flat terrain where topography and diurnal wind patterns are not a concern.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Wind Blowing Uphill/Downhill</h2>
        <p>Selecting Wind Blowing Uphill or Wind Blowing Downhill applies the wind direction either up or down hill based on aspect, which is part of the landscape file. Flat cells, with no aspect, use the direction you specify in the wind direction field.</p>
        <p>This option would be appropriate for modeling the fire behavior with simple diurnal winds. Uphill winds can also be used to calculate a near-maximum fire behavior characteristics.</p>
