        <h1>Input File for FlamMap 6.0</h1>
        <p>The Input file is only available in the download package from IFTDSS. It is a text file that contains information about the model run, the inputs used to run the model, and the outputs requested by the model. An Inputs file can be opened with a text editor such as NotePad, but the real utility is in FlamMap 6. This file can be used along with your landscape file (available for downloaded from IFTDSS) and your fire size list (in the same download package as the Input file) to run the same simulation in FlamMap 6.0.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of an Inputs file from a Landscape Burn Probability run completed in IFTDSS with both gridded winds and fuel moisture conditioning.</p>
