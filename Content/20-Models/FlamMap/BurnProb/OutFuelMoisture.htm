        <h1>Fuel Moisture (1, 10, 100 hr time lag classes)</h1>
        <p>Fuel Moisture is viewable in Map Studio (see images below) and available in the download package. Fuel moisture is the moisture content of dead woody fuels, it is the mass of water within the fuel particle expressed as a percentage of the fuel particle’s oven-dry mass. There are three classes of dead wood fuels based on their diameter, 1-hr (0 to ¼ inch or 0 to 6.4 mm in diameter), 10-hr (¼ to 1 inch or 0.6 to 2.5 cm in diameter) and 100-hr (dead woody fuel 1 to 3 inches or 2.5 to 7.6 cm in diameter).</p>
        <p>In Map Studio, the same classification is used for all three time lag classes. Fuel moisture is displayed by 1% classes through 12%, then based on moisture Albini (1976) of extinction break points for the higher classes.</p>
        <p>Example map showing 1-hr fuel moisture where <a href="../DeadFMConditioning.htm" target="_blank">dead fuel moisture conditioning</a> was not used. There are only two values on the map, 3% and non-burnable, this is because the initial fuel moisture entered for the model run is used across the entire landscape.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Example map showing the same area where dead fuel moisture conditioning using the Extreme classification was applied. Everything else with the model run was remained unchanged. The 1-hr fuel moistures range from &gt;2% to &lt;6%.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in the exact fuel moisture value of a point on the map, the Identify widget can be used in Map Studio.</p>

        <p>In the download package, 1 Hr Fuel Moisture, 10 Hr Fuel Moisture, and 100 Hr Fuel Moisture are each bands in the GeoTiff. They have continuous values as a fraction (i.e. 3.2% would be 0.032 in the GeoTiff). Where non-burnable pixels exist, the value is -1.</p>
