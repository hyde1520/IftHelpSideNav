        <h1>Landscapes for Burn Probability</h1>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>When choosing a landscape for LBP, only those landscapes with a buffer and unaltered resolution are available from the drop-down menu. (Landscapes with the suffix “NB” or “Xm” will not run with LBP).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Do not compare outputs across analyses.  Within the limitations of the application, it is best to ensure that your model run incorporates the entire landscape within which you want to compare burn probability calculation results.  In most cases this would be a project area boundary but in some cases could be larger to encompass an entire ownership area (district or park).</p>
