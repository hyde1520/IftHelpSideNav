        <h1>Resolution</h1>
        <p>The resolution of the Landscape Burn Probability calculations and outputs are set automatically based on landscape size. Landscapes greater than 250,000 acres ( including the <a href="../../../10-MapStudio/Files/LCPInfo.htm" target="_blank">buffered area</a>) will be <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YpKf3FvSAnzyQfc34E2oXcLjTqiY2x1_fWlKyRNOZRY" target="_blank">resampled</a>.  After a run is completed you will be able to view, download, and generate reports for both the landscape and the model outputs at the resampled resolution. This allows for correct summarization and interpretation of model outputs based on the landscape characteristics used for modeling.</p>
        <p>Model outputs that have been run with a resampled landscape are easily identified in IFTDSS by the model run name, which will have the resolution automatically added to the end. For example “BLM Grants Pass Very Low Conditioning-120m” indicates that the model output resolution is 120m.</p>
