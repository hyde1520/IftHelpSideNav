        <h1>Number of Fires Simulated</h1>

        <p>The Landscape Burn Probability model uses thousands of randomly located ignitions that are allowed to spread into fires for the specified Burn Period Length. Only, ignitions that are placed on burnable fuels are kept and recorded. If an ignition randomly lands on non-burnable fuel model it is removed from the simulation and does not count toward the total count. Each ignition is placed on a unburned landscape, prior ignitions do not alter fuels, weather conditions are held constant for the duration of the burn period, and it is the same for every fire.</p>
        <p>The number of random ignitions and therefore fires simulated is determined by IFTDSS and is based upon:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Landscape Size. Larger landscapes often require more fires than smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Fire Behavior Fuel Models present. Landscapes with fuel models characterized by faster rates of spread will need fewer ignitions than “slower” ones.</li>
            <li>Fuel Moisture and Wind Speed. Similar to fuels, higher wind speeds and lower fuel moistures result in faster rates of spread and require fewer ignitions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the best results, there should be minimal area within a landscape that is burnable that does not burn. Once this has been achieved increasing the number of ignitions does not significantly change the outputs but does increase processing time. Setting the correct number of ignitions to achieve this often takes a lot of trial and error.</p>
        <p>In order to streamline this process, IFTDSS determines the number of ignitions to be used for each run. In IFTDSS, at a minimum 1,000 fires will be used.  In the case that 1,000 fires is not sufficient, IFTDSS will keep adding ignitions until at least 98% of burnable pixels on the landscape burn or there is no significant change to the percentage burned even if the 98% target is not hit.The goal of 98% of burnable pixels burned may not be achieved because of a few reasons.  One example is a landscape with many small islands of burnable fuels surrounded by non-burnable fuels. Here the chance of random ignitions landing and fire spreading in all of them is minimal, and the computing time to do this is excessive.  Another example is entering conditions (e.g., wet initial fuel moistures or very slow wind speeds) where fire spread is minimal, the number of ignitions to achieve 98% of burnable fuels will take longer than is possible to model with IFTDSS.</p>
        <p>You can check the status of a run as it progresses, from the Playground, hover over or click your model run name and look at the bottom of the Right Hand Panel.  Refreshing the status column will update the values allowing you to track the progress of the model.  Once the run is completed the header title to this section will change from “In Progress Fire Summary” to “Completed Fire Summary.”</p>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">[Image here, but pretty minor, wait to add, includes number of fires run, etc.]</p>
        <p>Once a run is completed the final number of fires run, number of fires failed, and percentage of burnable cells burned are available in the right hand panel of both the Playground and the Workspace, as well as the View Inputs popup in the Playground. A fire can fail if the ignition lands on burnable fuels, but does not get large enough to burn onto an adjacent pixel.</p>
