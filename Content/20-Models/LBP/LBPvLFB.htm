        <p>Whether you choose to run Landscape Burn Probability or Landscape Fire Behavior will depend upon the questions you are trying to answer. In the table below, some questions are better addressed by one model, others are answered by both models.</p>

        <h2>Different Modeling Approaches</h2>
        <p>The two models also approach fire behavior modeling differently. Landscape Fire Behavior models head fire only and each pixel is assigned fire spread independently. This results in higher fire intensity. Landscape Burn Probability takes into account backing and flanking fire, as well as the influence of neighboring pixels which can result in lower intensity.</p>
        <p>Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) model outputs differ from Landscape Fire Behavior (LFB) model outputs in a number of ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>LFB outputs are deterministic - the same set of inputs will produce the same set of outputs each time.</li>
            <li>LBP outputs are probabilistic, the calculations include some randomization for ignitions and spotting, meaning that the results are not necessarily repeatable each time. LBP outputs are relative only to the geographic extent of a particular analysis.</li>
            <li>LBP outputs are specifically classified to describe the relative frequency at which different portions of the landscape would burn under a given set of conditions.</li>
        </ol>

                    <td class="TableStyle-Standard-BodyD-Column1-Body1">deterministic - same inputs will always yield the same outputs</td>
                </tr>

                    <td class="TableStyle-Standard-BodyB-Column1-Body2">Outputs depend on the scale of the landscape</td>

            <p>Landscape Burn Probability Model Outputs are visible in Map Studio with a color ramp scale from blue to red. Landscape Fire Behavior Model Outputs scale from green to red to help you clearly differentiate between the two model outputs.</p>

        <p>It is important to note the distinction between LFB Flame Length and LBP Conditional Flame Length.  In LFB flame length for a given pixel is always the same value based on a single head fire calculation.  LPB conditional flame length is the mean of the full spectrum of heading, backing, and flanking simulated fires run in the burn probability calculation. Understanding that a conditional flame length may vary significantly within a probability run or that it is close to the “edge” of a classification breakpoint may be useful for interpretation.</p>
