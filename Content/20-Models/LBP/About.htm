				IFTDSS Landscape Burn Probability is an independent model in Playground. The model is the foundation of the <a href="../../30-Tasks/QWRA/QWRAAbout.htm" target="_blank">Quantitative Wildland Fire Risk Assessment</a> process (<a href="../../41-References/Citations.htm#Scott_etal_2013" target="_blank">Scott and others 2013</a>) that will be released incrementally.

            <p>IFTDSS can process a limited number of LBP runs at a time. You can <a href="#lbprunqueue">check your run queue position in the Playground</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) quantifies the relative likelihood and intensity of a fire occurring under a fixed set of weather and fuel moisture conditions. Outputs include burn probability, conditional flame length and integrated hazard.  Outputs can be utilized as an independent product or be combined with information on the fire susceptibility of highly valued resources and assets.</p>
        <p>The LBP model is not as widely known as the more common fire spread models so it may be new to you. Please read the <a href="RunConsiderations.htm" target="_blank">Modeling Considerations</a> section to better understand how to use and apply this model to your work.</p>

                <p>The two models also approach fire behavior modeling differently. Landscape Fire Behavior models head fire only and each pixel is assigned fire spread independently. This results in higher fire intensity. Landscape Burn Probability takes into account heading, backing and flanking fire, as well as the influence of neighboring pixels which can result in lower intensity.</p>

                <p>The LBP model is a tool that is available to help address a variety of fuels planning and wildland fire management questions. IFTDSS maps and summary reports for this model may be helpful in the decision making process for treatment type, location, and prioritization when conducting NEPA or other analyses.</p>
                <p>Landscape Burn Probability can help answer questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which areas on the landscape are more likely to burn than others?</li>
                    <li>How likely is my ownership to burn as compared to immediately adjacent ownerships and inholdings?</li>
                    <li>Which areas will burn with the highest intensity?</li>
                    <li>Which areas on this landscape would benefit from treatments with objectives of reducing fire intensity in areas that are most likely to burn?</li>
                    <li>How do I decide which treatment area has a higher priority than another?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Example  - How to use LBP&#160;to Prioritize Treatment Location within Your&#160;Project&#160;Area</h3>
                <p><b>Scenario:</b> You are working on a Community Wildfire Protection Planning team and are tasked with helping to determine where in your county the likelihood of fire burning is highest during elevated fire danger.  This is in an effort to prioritize where limited fuel reduction treatment funds should be allocated county wide.</p>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b>  Create or upload a polygon representing your county and create a Landscape for your project area.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Models/LBP/MN_LBP_example1.png" alt="two screen captures showing a county next to a lake on the left, and a landscape file for that county on the right" class="border" />
                </p>
                <p><b>Step 2:</b>  Run the Landscape Burn Probability model.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wind and fuel moisture inputs should represent a worst case weather scenario (90th percentile or greater).</li>
                    <li>Simulation Time should represent the duration of worst case burn period in hours.</li>
                    <li>Spotting probability may be left at the default of 20% in many cases, however that value can be changed if needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Step 3:</b>  Analyze outputs in the Map Studio and Reports and interpret. In this case:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Areas of highest Burn Probability are located in the center and southwest portion of the county.</p>
                        <p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Average Conditional Flame Lengths are fairly high across the entire county in areas away from the shore of Lake Superior.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>When considering the likelihood of fire burning coupled with predicted intensity under extreme weather and fuel conditions, the areas in the central and southwest portion of the county seem to be the likely places to consider implementing fuel reduction treatments due because of elevated Integrated Hazard.</p>
