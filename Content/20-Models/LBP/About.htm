        <p>Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) quantifies the likelihood of fire occurring and the intensity at which fire occurs, it is part of the wildfire risk assessment process (<a href="../../41-References/Citations.htm#Scott_etal_2013" target="_blank">Scott and others 2013</a>). Outputs can be utilized as an independent product or be combined with information on the fire susceptibility of resources and assets to perform a more thorough integrated hazard or quantitative wildfire risk assessment. IFTDSS <a href="Out/Overview.htm" target="_blank">LBP model outputs</a> include burn probability, conditional flame length, and integrated hazard.</p>

                <p>Landscape Burn Probability is different from the Landscape Fire Behavior model founds elsewhere in IFTDSS. Here is a brief outline of those differences, highlight in more detail in a <a href="LBPvLFB.htm" target="_blank">separate topic page</a>:</p>
                <p>Whether you choose to run Landscape Burn Probability or Landscape Fire Behavior will depend upon the questions you are trying to answer. As sown in the table below, some questions are better addressed by one model, others are answered by both models.</p>

                <p>The two models also approach fire behavior modeling differently. Landscape Fire Behavior models head fire only and each pixel is assigned fire spread independently. This results in higher fire intensity. Landscape Burn Probability takes into account heading, backing and flanking fire, as well as the influence of neighboring pixels which can result in lower intensity.</p>
                <p>The LBP model outputs differ from LFB model outputs in a number of ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>LFB outputs are deterministic - the same set of inputs will produce the same set of outputs each time.</li>
                    <li>LBP outputs are probabilistic - the calculations include some randomization for ignitions and spotting.</li>
                    <li>LBP outputs are specifically classified to describe the relative frequency at which different portions of the landscape would burn under a given set of conditions.</li>
                    <li>LBP outputs are relative only to the geographic extent of a particular analysis.</li>
                    <li>LBP conditional flame length is the mean of the full spectrum of heading, backing, and flanking simulated fires run in the LBP calculation.  LFB flame length for a given pixel is always the same value based on a single head fire calculation.</li>

                <p>The LBP model is a tool that is available to help address a variety of fuels planning and wildland fire response questions. IFTDSS maps and summary reports for this model may be helpful in the decision making process for treatment type, location, and prioritization, when conducting NEPA or other analyses.</p>
                <p>Landscape Burn Probability can help answer questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which areas on the landscape are more likely to burn than others?</li>
                    <li>How likely is my ownership to burn as compared to immediately adjacent ownerships and inholdings?</li>
                    <li>Which areas will burn with the highest intensity?</li>
                    <li>Which areas on this landscape would benefit from treatments with objectives of reducing fire intensity in areas that are most likely to burn?</li>
                    <li>How do I decide which treatment area has a higher priority than another?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Example Fuel Treatment Prioritization: how to use the LBP Outputs to select one treatment area over another</h3>
                <h4>Scenario</h4>
                <p> Two treatment areas have been identified, but there are only enough funds to implement one of the two treatments this year. How can I use the LBP model to inform my decision on which treatment to implement?</p>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Identify your treatment area boundaries (Treatment A and Treatment B below)</p>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Run the LBP model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wind and fuel moisture inputs should represent a worst case weather scenario (90th percentile or greater).</li>
                    <li>Simulation Time should represent the duration of the worst case burn period in hours.</li>
                    <li>Spotting probability may be left at the default of 20% in many cases, however that value may be change if needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>View each of the outputs in relation to where each treatment area is located.</p>
                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burn Probability (the relative likelihood that a fire will burn under a fixed set of weather and fuel moisture conditions) - Treatment A has a much lower burn probability (likelihood) of burning than treatment area B.</li>
                    <li>Conditional Flame Length (mean flame length of all simulated fires) - There are places within Treatment Area B that have higher conditional flame lengths.</li>
                    <li>Integrated Hazard (combination of conditional flame length and burn probability) - there are similarities between both treatments  - one does not necessarily stand out from the other.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These outputs should be considered in conjunction with treatment objectives, fuel models/vegetation types within the treatment area, resource values, difficulty of implementation etc. to help determine which treatment should be the priority. In this case you may choose to implement Treatment B since the likelihood of a fire burning is higher and the other factors are similar. There may be many other factors to weigh in this decision so each situation will be unique. (see Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment info)</p>

                <h3>Outputs are uniquely scaled for each analysis or Area of Interest (link to modeling considerations) for in depth information</h3>
                <p>The most important thing to remember when using burn probability outputs is that they are <span class="Emphasis">relative within the landscape or area of interest</span>.  Outputs must be viewed within the context of the landscape they are generated in. For example, a red pixel in one analysis still may be a much lower burn probability than a yellow or blue pixel in another analysis with a different landscape, different weather, or different fuel moisture inputs.  You cannot compare two landscapes that have had burn probably run on them individually, each case is unique.</p>

                <p>The legend in the Landscape Burn probability lists the “Analysis Maximum” for that analysis, the colored classes in the legend are scaled based on this value. The colored classes are not evenly distributed but rather are all in relation to the analysis maximum.  As a result some analysis outputs may be heavily skewed to just one or two classes depending on the range of results.  Each pixel has a unique burn probability which can be determined by using the Identify tool.</p>

Outputs can be utilized as an independent product or be combined with information on resource susceptibility to perform a more thorough quantitative wildfire risk assessment. IFTDSS burn probability outputs include metrics on burn probability and conditional flame length.</p>
            <div class="notificationComingSoon">

            <h2>Why Model Landscape Burn Probability</h2>
            <p>Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) outputs differ from other fire behavior models (e.g. Landscape Fire Behavior) and fire spread models (e.g. Minimum Travel Time) outputs in that they are not absolute.  Landscape Burn Probability outputs are classified to describe the relative frequency at which different portions of the landscape would burn under a given set of conditions.  In the example below, you can see that while individual pixels across a landscape may show high rates of spread or flame lengths, the relative likelihood of those areas actually burning may be very low.  This information can be very useful for both fuels treatment planning and active fire management response planning in terms of understanding the likely distribution and frequency of fire impacting different portions of the landscape in relation to one another.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="notificationTip">
                <p>Landscape Burn Probability Outputs are visible in Map Studio with a color ramp scale from blue to red. Landscape Fire Behavior Model Outputs scale from green to red to help you clearly differentiate between the two model outputs.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Modeling Landscape Burn Probability across a landscape or area of interest provides information on the <span class="Emphasis">relative</span> likelihood that fire will burn in different areas under a fixed set of weather and fuel moisture conditions. This information can be useful to prioritize treatment types and locations on a landscape based on the relative likelihood of fire occurrence. IFTDSS maps and summary reports for this model may also be helpful in documenting the decision making process for treatment type, location, and prioritization when conducting NEPA or other analyses.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Landscape Burn Probability can be used in conjunction with other model outputs to answer different fire management questions.  For example areas with high flame lengths (shown in red above) may have a low burn probability (shown in blue above). Such scenarios might include isolated shrub patches surrounded by non-burnable areas, or fuels with slower spread rates.</p>

                <p>Burn Probability outputs cannot be compared between landscapes.  The model outputs are scaled to show relative distribution within each specific analysis landscape.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The most important thing to remember when using burn probability outputs is that they are relative within the landscape or area of interest.  Outputs must be viewed within the context of the landscape they are generated in. For example, a red pixel in one analysis still may be a much lower burn probability than a yellow or blue pixel in another analysis with a different landscape, different weather, or different fuel moisture inputs.  You cannot compare two landscapes that have had burn probably run on them individually, each case is unique.</p>
            <p>A visual example of how unique LBP outputs can be is displayed in the run comparison below. This comparison was done on the same landscape, weather, and fuel moisture parameters, wind direction was the only parameter changed. The first output was run with a Southeast wind and the second with a Northwest wind.  You can see that the burnable area SE of the larger lake to the west did not even burn under a NW wind direction.</p>

            <h2>How is Burn Probability Calculated?</h2>
            <p>In IFTDSS, users specify a worst-case weather scenario for a landscape, and the system will run the Minimum Travel Time (MTT)  algorithm (Finney 2002) across the landscape, potentially thousands of times, until 98% of the burnable landscape has burned. MTT runs with weather inputs and fuel moistures held constant. Each MTT calculation is simulated on an identical  unbured copy of the landscape, thus individual fire simulations do not interact or influence each other.</p>
            <p>MTT does takes into account heading, flanking, and backing fires, as well as both surface and crown fire spread.  While each MTT run is independent, fire spread within each MTT simulation does take into account fire spread characteristics so individual pixels may be influenced by adjacent pixels within each of the thousands of MTT runs.</p>
            <p>Landscape Burn probability is:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>The number of times a pixel burns / total number of fires simulated</i>
            </p>
            <p>Landscape Burn probability will display the likelihood of a pixel burning relative to other pixels in the analysis area extent. For example, if the model ran 17,000 fire simulations, and a pixel burned 17,000 times, it would have burn probability of 1.0, (17,000/17,000=1.0). If a pixel never burned during those 17,000 fire simulations, it would have a burn probability of 0 (0/17,000=0).</p>
