        <p>Select Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) outputs are available as geospatial layers in Map Studio and within summary reports.</p>
        <p>The model outputs can be added to the map using the <a href="../../../10-MapStudio/Functions/SimulationTools.htm" target="_blank">Simulation Output Tools</a> widget or from Playground or Workspace by clicking <span class="UIcomponent">View on Map</span>. In Map Studio you can view:</p>

        <h2>A First Look with Layer List</h2>
        <p>In this example Burn Probability is shown below in Map Studio with the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_layerlist.png" class="iftbutton" alt="layer list button" /></span> displaying the legend. The landscape extent (non-buffered)  is represented by the area within the turquoise box. The area outside the turquoise box is the buffer area that was required for the model to run.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/LBP_output_example.png" class="border" alt="landscape and buffer area showing landscape burn probability indicated in  a cool to warm color scheme." />
        </p>
        <h2>More Detail with Identify</h2>
        <p>The <span class="UIcomponent">Identify widget <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_identify.png" alt="identify" class="iftbutton" /></span> displays additional information not shown in the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_layerlist.png" class="iftbutton" alt="layer list" /></span>. This includes, the proportion of flame lengths in the six fire intensity levels, burn probability for a specific pixel, 20 ft wind speed, and wind direction. In the example below, burn probability values are shown as a continuous number, and Proportion of Flame Length is assigned a percent for each class.</p>

        <h2>Landscape Summary Burn Probability Reports</h2>
        <p>In summary reports only Burn Probability and Conditional Flame Length outputs are included. Reports can be created from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> by expanding the menu below a LBP model output and clicking <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Models/LBP/request_LBP_report.png" alt="reports are generated from the workspace with the 'request a report' button" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>In the window that opens there are two options for generating a report:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate report for this area of interest: allows you to select an AOI from existing shapes or shapefiles that intersect the landscape extent (non-buffered).  When an AOI is used only the area within the AOI and landscape extent (non-buffered) is included in the map image and the summarized values.</li>
            <li>Generating a report for the entire landscape extent (non-buffered). This is done by leaving field under "Generate report for this area..." blank.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is an example report  section for Conditional Flame Length where an AOI was selected. The summarized data in the chart and table are the same as the extent viewed on the map.  This example only describes the area within the AOI.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Below is an Example of a report section for Conditional Flame Length without an AOI. The summarized data in the chart and table are the same as the extent viewed on the map. This example only describes the area within the Landscape Extent (non buffered area within the turquoise box).</p>
