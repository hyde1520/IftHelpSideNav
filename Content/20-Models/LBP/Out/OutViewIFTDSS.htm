        <h1>Viewing Burn Probability Outputs in IFTDSS</h1>
        <p>Select Landscape Burn Probability outputs are available as geospatial layers in Map Studio and within Reports.</p>
        <p>The model outputs can be added to the map using the <a href="../../../10-MapStudio/Functions/SimulationTools.htm" target="_blank">Simulation Output Tools</a> widget or from Playground or Workspace by clicking the View on Map button. In Map Studio you can view:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Burn Probability</li>
            <li>Conditional Flame Length</li>
            <li>Midflame Wind Speed</li>
            <li>1 hr Fuel Moisture</li>
            <li>10 hr Fuel Moisture</li>
            <li>100 hr Fuel Moisture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example Landscape Burn Probability is shown below in Map Studio with the Layer List displaying the legend. The landscape is represented by the area within the turquoise box. The area outside the turquoise box is the buffer area that was required for the model to run.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Identify widget has additional information that is not displayed in Layer List. This includes, the proportion of flame lengths in the six fire intensity levels, 20 ft wind speed, and wind direction. Note the below example for Landscape Burn Probability where the values are shown as a continuous number, and Conditional Flame Length is assigned a percent for each class.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In Reports only the Burn Probability and Conditional Flame Length outputs are included. They are displayed the same was as in Map Studio in the map image supplied.</p>
