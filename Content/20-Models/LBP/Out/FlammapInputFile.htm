            <MadCap:keyword term="FlamMap" />Input File for FlamMap 6.0</h1>
        <p>The Input file is only available in the download package from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>The Input File is a text file that contains information about the model run, the inputs used to run the model, and the outputs requested by the model. An Inputs file can be opened with a text editor such as NotePad, but the real utility is in FlamMap 6.0. This file can be used along with your landscape file (available for downloaded from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />) and your fire size list (in the same download package as the Input file) to run the same simulation in FlamMap 6.0.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of an Inputs file from a LBP run completed in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> with both gridded winds and fuel moisture conditioning.</p>
