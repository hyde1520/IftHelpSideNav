            <p>LBP, and the integrated hazard map included with it, displays the components needed to conduct an exposure analysis. Throughout 2019 we will continue to release additional components of this assessment until a complete exposure analysis task is available in IFTDSS by the end of 2019</p>

        <p>Hazard describes a physical situation with potential for harm to persons or damage to resources and assets. Wildfire hazard can be described qualitatively as a fire environment—fuel, weather, topography, and ignitions—with potential for causing harm or damage, or quantitatively by two characteristics: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> the probability of a fire occurring at a specific point during a specified time period, and </li>
            <li>the expected distribution of intensity given that the event does occur. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wildfire hazard at a given location on the landscape is quantified as: </p>
        <p>Those two characteristics can be combined into a single spatially resolved measure of wildfire hazard: integrated wildfire hazard. It is important to note that since the definition of risk in the wildfire context is expanded to include beneficial as well as negative effects, the consideration of wildfire likelihood and intensity (in other words, hazard) should be expanded as well.</p>
