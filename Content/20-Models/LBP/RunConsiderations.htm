        <h1>LBP Model Run Considerations and Interpretation<MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Development.flsnp" /></h1>
        <p>Burn Probability is likely a new fire behavior model for many users. Although most of the inputs are similar to Landscape Fire Behavior the outputs are quite different. The information laid out below is very important and will help provide a better understanding of the nuances of selecting inputs, running the model, and interpreting the outputs.</p>
        <p> 
The table below outlines key considerations as you select your landscape, choose inputs for the model, and interpret model outputs.</p>

        <h2><a name="Scale"></a>Scale</h2>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Outputs are uniquely scaled for each analysis or Area of Interest.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The most important thing to remember when using burn probability outputs is that they are <span class="Emphasis">relative within the landscape or area of interest</span>.  Outputs must be viewed within the context of the landscape they are generated in. For example, a red pixel in one analysis still may be a much lower burn probability than a yellow or blue pixel in another analysis with a different landscape, different weather, or different fuel moisture inputs. A prime example of this can be seen when comparing the various example images in the <a href="Out/OutViewIFTDSS.htm#Viewing_w_masks" target="_blank">Viewing outputs with masks topic</a>. You cannot compare two landscapes that have had burn probably run on them individually, each case is unique.</p>
        <p>The outputs should be evaluated in the context of the management questions being asked and keeping model inputs in mind, especially wind speed and direction.</p>
        <h2><a name="CFL"></a>LBP Conditional Flame Length</h2>
        <p>Conditional flame length should not be compared directly flame length outputs from Landscape Fire Behavior. In addition to being calculated differently, conditional flame length may vary significantly within a probability run or that it is close to the “edge” of a classification breakpoint may be useful for interpretation.</p>
        <p><a name="Affects_of_landscape_features_and_wind"></a>
        </p>
        <h2>Affects of landscape features and wind</h2>
        <p>In some model outputs you may encounter areas with high conditional flame lengths and low burn probabilities. Causes for this can  include fuels that are located in difficult locations for fire to spread to, such as highly flammable but patchy fuels. Some examples of this are high elevation timber pockets, or shrub islands surrounded by non-burnable fuels (pictured below).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Another cause of low burn probability in seemingly volatile fuels can be slow spreading or non-burnable fuels upwind depending on the wind direction specified in the analysis.</p>
        <p>A visual example of how unique LBP outputs can be based on wind direction is displayed in the run comparison below. This comparison was done on the same landscape, with the same wind speed, spotting probability and fuel moisture parameters.  Wind direction was the only parameter changed. The first output was run with a Southeast wind and the second with a Northwest wind.  You can see that the burnable area SE of the larger lake to the west did not even burn under a NW wind direction.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>There are also scenarios that may be associated with high burn probabilities and low conditional flame length. These can include continuous grass or shrub fuels especially when wind and moisture inputs conducive to rapid spread.</p>
