        <p>Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) is likely a new fire behavior model for many users. Although most of the inputs are similar to Landscape Fire Behavior the outputs are quite different. The information laid out below is very important and will help provide a better understanding of the nuances of selecting inputs, running the model, and interpreting the outputs.</p>
        <p>This table summarizes the key information about the Inputs and Outputs. Click on the links for more in depth information about each item.</p>

        <h2><a name="LBPsensitivities"></a>LBP Model Input Sensitivities</h2>
        <p>Isolating on model sensitives on a particular landscape is the responsibility of the user through trial and error in the model calibration process.  It may be important to iterate on a number of model runs changing one input at a time to understand how the features and fuels on your landscape influence the model outputs. This is an important part of the model calibration process. An example of model sensitivity to wind direction and landscape features is included below.</p>
        <h3>Example: wind direction and landscape features on burn probability</h3>
        <p>Inputs such as wind direction or landscape features may affect outputs in unusual ways, such as producing areas with high conditional flame lengths but low burn probabilities. Causes for this can include fuels that are located in difficult locations for fire to spread to, such as highly flammable but patchy fuels. Some examples of this are high elevation timber pockets, or shrub islands surrounded by non-burnable fuels (pictured below).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Models/LBP/fire_barriers.png" class="border" alt="two images, left shows vegetation patches separated by water. The right image shows two stands of trees separated by short sparse grass." />
        </p>
        <p>The interaction of wind with landscape features can also contribute to low burn probabilities in seemingly volatile fuels, such as in cases where there are non-burnable or slow-spreading fuels upwind. A visual example of this is displayed below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Models/LBP/LFB_LBP_compare_3.png" alt="in the landscape with SE winds most of the area burned, in the landscape with NW winds, there are patches of unburned area" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>The two burn probability outputs were generated with identical inputs with the exception of wind direction. The first output was run with a Southeast wind and the second with a Northwest wind.  You can see in the example with NW Wind, that the burnable area on the east end of the lake was sheltered by the water and did not burn (black polygon) whereas it did burn in the same scenario under SE winds.</p>
