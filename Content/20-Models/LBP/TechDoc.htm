        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Models/CalculationSourceCallOut.flsnp" />
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) model is identical to Minimum Travel Time (MTT) Burn Probability  in FlamMap 6.0, with some fixed modeling inputs (see <a href="#Fixedinputs">below</a> for details).</p>
        <h2>FlamMap MTT Background</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/Map_int_hazard_techdoc.png" alt="integrated hazard layer over topographic features" style="float: right;" class="border" />

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Models/MttTechDocInfo.flsnp" />
        <p>For LBP, thousands of randomly located ignitions are used and the resulting fires are spread using the MTT algorithm until 98% percent of the burnable landscape has burned.  The probability of burning and resulting fire intensity is calculated from these repeated simulations. See the <a href="Out/Overview.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Burn Probability Output Overview</a> topic for more details.</p>
        <h2><a name="Fixedinputs"></a>Fixed inputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p>Many of the model inputs are controlled by the user (see the <a href="In/OverviewLBP.htm" target="_blank">Input Overview</a> topic for more details); however some model inputs are fixed in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> LBP runs and cannot be changed by the user:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolution of the run: Landscapes over 250,000 acres are resampled prior to model run initiation (See the <a href="../Resampling.htm" target="_blank">Resampling</a> topic for more details).</li>
            <li>Number of fires simulated: Ignitions are randomly located. A minimum 1,000 fires is used. In the case that 1,000 fires is not sufficient, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> keeps adding ignitions until at least 98% of burnable pixels (cells) on the landscape burn or there is no significant change to the percentage burned even if the 98% target is not hit (see the <a href="In/NoFiresSimLBP.htm" target="_blank">Number of Fires Simulated</a> topic for more details).</li>
            <li>Spotting delay: The time between ember landing and initiation of fire spread is set to 0 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spotting seed: The spotting seed is a randomly generated value that determines whether or not a specific spot causes an ignition. In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the spotting seed is set for the first model run for a given <a href="../../20-Landscapes/LCPTerminology.htm#Landscape_family" target="_blank">landscape family</a> and Fire Size List (see the <a href="Out/FireSizeList.htm" target="_blank">Fire Size List</a> topic for more details). Subsequent runs using the same combination re-use the spotting seed. This allows for accurate comparisons between model runs using the same landscape family and ignition. Such comparisons can be useful to test the effectiveness of fuel treatment alternatives or to compare the impacts of changing weather parameters. Were spotting seed not held constant in these scenarios, you would be unable to deduce whether changes in fire behavior were due to the changes you specified or the result of differences in spotting.</li>

            <h2><a name="Comparison"></a>Comparison to other Risk Assessments</h2>
            <p>There are two key differences between the risk assessment approach used by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> and FlamMap, relative to the  Large Fire Simulation Model (FSim, <a href="../../41-References/Citations.htm#Finney_etal_2011" target="_blank">Finney and others 2011</a>):</p>
