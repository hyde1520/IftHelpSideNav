        <h1>Technical Documentation - Landscape Burn Probability with FlamMap 6.0<MadCap:keyword term="LBP" /><MadCap:keyword term="Landscape Burn Probability" /></h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Landscape Burn Probability (LBP) model is identical to Minimum Travel Time (MTT) Burn Probability  in FlamMap 6.0, with some fixed modeling inputs (see <a href="#Fixedinputs">below</a> for details).</p>
        <h2>FlamMap MTT Background</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/Map_int_hazard_techdoc.png" alt="integrated hazard layer over topographic features" style="float: right;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Models/MttTechDocInfo.flsnp" />
        <p>For LBP, thousands of randomly located ignitions are used and the resulting fires are spread using the MTT algorithm until 98% percent of the burnable landscape has burned.  The probability of burning and resulting fire intensity is calculated from these repeated simulations. See the <a href="Out/Overview.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Burn Probability Output Overview</a> topic for more details.</p>
        <h2><a name="Fixedinputs"></a>Fixed inputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h2>
        <p>Many of the model inputs are controlled by the user (see the <a href="In/OverviewLBP.htm" target="_blank">Input Overview</a> topic for more details); however some model inputs are fixed in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> LBP runs and cannot be changed by the user:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolution of the run: Landscapes over 250,000 acres are resampled prior to model run initiation (See the <a href="../Resampling.htm" target="_blank">Resampling</a> topic for more details).</li>
            <li>Number of fires simulated: Ignitions are randomly located, they are simulated thousands of times until 98% of the landscape has burned (see the <a href="In/NoFiresSimLBP.htm" target="_blank">Number of Fires Simulated</a> topic for more details).</li>
            <li>Spotting delay: The time between ember landing and initiation of fire spread is set to 0 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spotting seed: The spotting seed is randomly generated number generated for each run. The spotting seed is used to fix spotting distance and location when a Fire Size List (see the <a href="Out/FireSizeList.htm" target="_blank">Fire Size List</a> topic for more details) is used to fix ignition locations to compare between alternatives for a single landscapes.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2><a name="Comparison"></a>Comparison to other Risk Assessments</h2>
            <p>There are two key differences between the risk assessment approach used by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> and FlamMap, relative to the  Large Fire Simulation Model (FSim, <a href="../../41-References/Citations.htm#Finney_etal_2011" target="_blank">Finney and others 2011</a>):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weather over time</li>
                <li>Suppression efforts</li>
            </ul>
