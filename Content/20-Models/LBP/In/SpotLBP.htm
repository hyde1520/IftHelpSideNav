            <p>Spotting Probability is treated differently by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> than in WFDSS NTFB / FARSITE.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Spotting, the launching of embers and spread of resulting spot fires, is included within models that incorporate fire spread. In IFTDSS, spotting is part of the Landscape Burn Probability (LBP)  model. Spotting only occurs in trees where active or passive crown fire is initiated, it does not occur in surface fire or slash pile burning.</p>
