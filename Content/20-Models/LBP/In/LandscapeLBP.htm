        <h1>Landscapes for LBP<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Development.flsnp" /></h1>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>When choosing a landscape for LBP, only those landscapes with a buffer and unaltered resolution are available from the drop-down menu. (Landscapes with the suffix “NB” or “Xm” will not run with LBP).</p>
        </div>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Avoid comparing outputs across analyses.</span>  Use a landscape that includes the entire area for which you may want to compare results. In most cases this would be a project area boundary but in some cases could be larger to encompass an entire ownership area (district or park).</p>
        <h2>Influence of Landscape Features and Wind</h2>
        <p>Inputs such as wind direction or landscape features may affect outputs in unusual ways, such as producing areas with high conditional flame lengths but low burn probabilities. Causes for this can include fuels that are located in difficult locations for fire to spread to, such as highly flammable but patchy fuels. Some examples of this are high elevation timber pockets, or shrub islands surrounded by non-burnable fuels (pictured below).</p>

        </p>
        <p>The interaction of wind with landscape features can also contribute to low burn probabilities in seemingly volatile fuels, such as in cases where there are non-burnable or slow-spreading upwind. A visual example of this is displayed below. The two burn probability outputs were generated with identical inputs with the exception of wind direction. The first output was run with a Southeast wind and the second with a Northwest wind.  You can see in the example with NW Wind, that the burnable area on the east end of the lake was sheltered by the water and did not burn, whereas it burned in the same scenario under SE winds.</p>

        </p>
        <p>There are also scenarios that may be associated with high burn probabilities and low conditional flame length. These can include continuous grass or shrub fuels especially when wind and moisture inputs conducive to rapid spread.</p>
