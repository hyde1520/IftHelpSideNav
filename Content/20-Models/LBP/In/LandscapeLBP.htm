        <h1>Landscapes for LBP<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Development.flsnp" /></h1>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>When choosing a landscape for LBP, only those landscapes with a buffer and unaltered resolution are available from the drop-down menu. (Landscapes with the suffix “NB” or “Xm” will not run with LBP).</p>
        </div>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Avoid comparing outputs across analyses.</span>  Use a landscape that includes the entire area for which you may want to compare results. In most cases this would be a project area boundary but in some cases could be larger to encompass an entire ownership area (district or park).</p>
