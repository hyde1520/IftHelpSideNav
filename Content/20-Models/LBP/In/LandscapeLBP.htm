        <h1>Landscapes for LBP<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Development.flsnp" /></h1>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>When choosing a landscape for LBP, only those landscapes with a buffer and unaltered resolution are available from the drop-down menu. (Landscapes with the suffix “NB” or “Xm” will not run with LBP).</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Choosing A Landscape Extent</h2>
        <p> Choose a Landscape size that includes the entire area for which you may want to compare the results of a single analysis. In most cases this would be a project area boundary but in some cases could be larger to encompass an entire ownership area (district or park).</p>
        <h2>Outputs are uniquely scaled for each analysis or Area of Interest</h2>
        <p>The most important thing to remember when using burn probability outputs is that they are <span class="Emphasis">relative within the landscape or area of interest</span>.  Outputs must be viewed within the context of the landscape they are generated in. For example, a red pixel in one analysis still may be a much lower burn probability than a yellow or blue pixel in another analysis with a different landscape, different weather, or different fuel moisture inputs.  You cannot compare two landscapes that have had burn probably run on them individually, each case is unique.</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Burn Probability outputs cannot be compared between landscapes.  The model outputs are scaled to show relative distribution within each specific analysis landscape.</p>
