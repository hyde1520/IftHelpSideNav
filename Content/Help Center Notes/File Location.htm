        <h1>File Location</h1>
        <p>Images are grouped in folders either by location in IFTDSS, Task in IFTDSS, or Model. These groups make it easy to change images throughout help center when a part of the application changes or when a model changes. For example, we have images of the planning cycle in multiple parts of the help, but the image files are stored in planning cycle. If the planning cycle changes look, update all the images in the planning cycle folder instead of having to search every task folder or model folder for images of the planning cycle. This same approach extends to images we have of systems external to IFTDSS. For example we have some short tutorials on Arc, FireFamily Plus etc. These are stored in the Images&gt;External folder and further broken out by application type. If Arcmap changes dramatically and images need updating, go the External folder and find the 'Arc' folder. </p>
